Reaume
My
first
subscription
to
Bitch
Magazine
was
a
gift
I
was
in
my
second
year
of
university
and
couldn
t
afford
to
subscribe
So
when
my
sister
asked
what
I
wanted
for
my
birthday
the
answer
was
easy
I
d
attended
Catholic
schools
my
whole
life
By
the
time
I
was
19
I
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
the
church
because
of
its
stance
on
abortion
and
queer
rights
But
I
wasn
t
exactly
sure
what
my
politics
were
I
was
definitely
a
feminist
that
much
I
knew
I
was
interested
in
social
justice
but
I
didn
t
really
know
what
was
possible
to
believe
politically
Growing
up
all
I
had
been
exposed
to
were
conservative
and
right-leaning
liberal
views
But
I
knew
I
wanted
more
More
rights
for
women
more
rights
for
LGTBQIA+
folks
more
rights
for
disabled
people
more
rights
for
racialized
people
and
more
economic
equality
Enter
Bitch
I
d
heard
about
the
magazine
on
feminist
blogs
like
Feministing
and
Pandagon
both
of
which
I
read
avidly
trying
to
map
and
shape
my
own
politics
I
searched
for
Bitch
on
the
magazine
racks
of
every
bookstore
I
visited
and
I
couldn
t
believe
it
when
I
finally
saw
a
physical
copy
of
the
magazine
on
a
shelf
in
a
women
s
bookstore
in
Vancouver
British
Columbia
My
breath
caught
I
remember
approaching
it
with
reverence
and
being
absorbed
in
its
pages
before
buying
it
along
with
two
back
issues
There
was
something
seductive
about
holding
these
magazines
written
for
feminists
in
my
hands
At
home
I
consumed
them
front
to
back
in
one
sitting
Everything
the
magazine
represented
went
against
what
I
d
learned
growing
up
I
felt
exhilarated
I
was
already
on
a
feminist
journey
when
I
encountered
Bitch
but
the
magazine
sparked
new
thoughts
It
deepened
my
analysis
For
a
women
s
studies
class
in
my
third
year
I
did
a
creative
project
inspired
by
an
article
in
Bitch
that
examined
the
ways
my
Catholic
school
education
had
harmed
me
The
publication
introduced
me
to
books
and
musicians
that
have
since
shaped
me
But
perhaps
more
importantly
it
showed
me
the
power
of
media
What
if
we
started
a
magazine
I
asked
my
friend
Kristen
three
years
after
becoming
a
Bitch
subscriber
We
had
been
talking
about
a
female
politician
who
d
recently
been
called
a
bimbo
in
the
media
because
she
had
long
blonde
hair
It
felt
to
us
like
women
couldn
t
win
when
it
came
to
power
and
we
were
discussing
how
angry
that
made
us
and
how
we
both
felt
powerless
to
change
it
Oh
I
like
that
idea
Kristen
responded
A
magazine
to
talk
about
feminism
and
the
challenges
women
face
in
relation
to
power
That
was
how
Antigone
Magazine
was
born
We
recruited
a
number
of
other
feminists
we
knew
and
together
we
named
the
publication
Antigone
inspired
by
the
Greek
figure
s
courage
and
determination
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
Through
the
magazine
we
wanted
to
help
young
women
express
and
do
what
they
thought
was
right
even
in
the
face
of
opposition
or
punishment
simply
because
they
were
women
We
wanted
to
embody
that
kind
of
defiance
Like
Bitch
we
wanted
to
reclaim
the
identity
of
the
troublemaker
We
published
Antigone
Magazine
on
our
campus
and
periodically
on
other
campuses
It
had
an
international
subscription
base
We
even
started
an
art
project
called
Dreams
for
Women
curating
and
posting
collaged
postcards
from
around
the
world
with
people
s
secret
hopes
for
women
on
them
The
project
was
featured
in
the
International
Museum
of
Women
The
group
of
women
that
became
involved
with
Antigone
over
the
years
organized
women
s
forums
and
a
national
conference
on
childcare
and
post-secondary
education
In
2008
I
was
invited
by
the
Governor
General
of
Canada
to
speak
about
women
and
politics
in
Ottawa
and
in
2009
was
also
part
of
a
Canadian
delegation
to
a
United
Nations
meeting
on
the
status
of
women
The
magazine
was
even
mentioned
in
a
textbook
on
women
s
history
We
re
no
longer
publishing
Antigone
but
it
s
still
making
an
impact
A
few
years
ago
one
of
our
subscribers
ran
for
office
and
told
me
Antigone
inspired
her
Recently
one
of
our
writers
published
a
book
about
foreign
policy
Another
person
is
the
managing
editor
of
a
national
news
agency
Some
of
us
became
teachers
Others
academics
Still
more
activists
We
haven
t
stopped
demanding
more
for
women
Bitch
will
soon
join
Antigone
in
the
graveyard
of
feminist
publications
Started
in
1996
by
Andi
Zeisler
Benjamin
Shaykin
and
Lisa
Jervis
Bitch
Media
announced
on
April
12
2022
that
it
would
cease
operations
in
June
The
announcement
hit
many
of
its
loyal
readers
hard
My
own
feminist
journey
along
with
those
of
the
phenomenal
women
who
collaborated
with
me
on
Antigone
are
the
types
of
stories
you
hear
when
people
talk
about
Bitch
The
publication
sparked
awakenings
Activism
Community
Change
It
was
loved
for
its
resolutely
queer
perspectives
its
intersectional
coverage
its
engagement
with
disability
justice
and
its
integration
of
economic
justice
The
magazine
talked
about
things
no
other
outlets
were
talking
about
and
pushed
the
conversation
forward
Many
even
credit
Bitch
with
making
space
for
other
popular
feminist
media
like
Jezebel
and
Teen
Vogue
But
as
people
appraise
the
media
organization
s
legacy
it
is
not
without
criticism
including
the
contention
that
for
all
their
coverage
of
labor
rights
the
magazine
worked
its
editors
and
writers
to
exhaustion
What
those
criticisms
show
is
that
even
as
the
magazine
is
shuttering
the
people
who
made
Bitch
great
are
still
leading
important
conversations
that
will
help
make
culture
work
and
feminist
media
better
Despite
its
organizational
challenges
Bitch
gave
voice
to
so
many
amazing
writers
it
s
their
work
I
want
to
celebrate
In
this
reading
list
I
ve
compiled
10
recommended
longreads
that
represent
some
of
the
best
of
Bitch
Magazine
over
the
years
And
since
the
organization
s
archives
will
remain
online
for
the
foreseeable
future
you
can
dig
into
and
re
discover
your
own
favorites
from
the
publication
too
In
light
of
the
recent
leak
of
Justice
Samuel
A
Alito
Jr.
s
draft
opinion
that
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
SCOTUS
has
voted
internally
to
overturn
Roe
v
Wade
one
thing
that
I
keep
returning
to
is
how
much
feminist
labor
went
into
trying
to
ensure
this
day
never
came
Much
of
that
labor
was
covered
or
inspired
by
Bitch
So
while
SCOTUS
could
still
choose
to
let
Roe
v
Wade
stand
there
is
something
deeply
tragic
about
the
shutdown
of
Bitch
in
a
time
when
we
urgently
need
feminist
media
I
want
to
recognize
the
work
the
magazine
has
done
in
the
past
on
reproductive
justice
including
looking
at
how
abortion
rights
were
co-opted
by
white
feminists
and
the
assault
on
the
reproductive
rights
of
refugees
and
immigrants
This
particular
piece
rounds
up
great
coverage
on
the
arguments
in
Dobbs
v
Jackson
from
when
the
case
went
before
the
courts
in
December
2021
and
what
action
you
can
take
If
you
re
someone
who
cares
about
protecting
the
right
to
bodily
autonomy
in
general
and
abortion
access
in
particular
you
re
already
aware
that
this
morning
s
oral
arguments
to
the
Supreme
Court
in
Dobbs
v
Jackson
are
the
culmination
of
a
decades-long
conservative
strategy
to
overturn
1973
s
historic
Roe
v
Wade
decision
But
that
doesn
t
mean
it
wasn
t
profoundly
unsettling
to
watch
the
nation
s
most
powerful
legal
body
debate
questions
that
should
be
easy
to
answer
Does
the
U.
S
government
have
the
right
to
force
a
person
to
carry
an
unwanted
pregnancy
to
term
Even
if
that
pregnancy
poses
a
serious
health
risk
Even
if
the
pregnancy
isn
t
viable
Even
if
the
pregnancy
itself
is
the
result
of
a
crime
Even
if
the
outcome
is
guaranteed
to
be
bad
for
the
humans
involved
Dr
Chandra
Prescod-Weinstein
s
2021
book
The
Disordered
Cosmos
A
Journey
into
Dark
Matter
Spacetime
and
Dreams
Deferred
took
the
world
by
storm
In
it
Prescod-Weinstein
explores
the
physics
of
melanin
in
skin
and
gives
an
overview
of
the
racism
and
misogyny
of
the
scientific
community
She
first
wrote
about
the
topic
in
Bitch
Magazine
This
piece
shows
how
the
publication
offered
many
writers
their
first
chance
to
explore
topics
that
would
later
create
significant
impact
Hundreds
of
years
after
the
advent
of
chattel
slavery
it
s
easy
to
see
why
race
is
defined
by
skin
color
Skin
color
offers
a
highly
visible
cue
that
makes
sorting
easy—at
least
until
rape
proliferates
The
variation
in
human
skin
tones
is
due
to
a
pigment
called
melanin
which
comes
from
the
Greek
word
melas
black
dark
Melanin
is
found
in
most
living
creatures
and
when
it
is
studied
scientifically
researchers
usually
use
the
ink
of
Sepia
officinalis
the
common
cuttlefish
Our
social
sorting
by
skin
color
can
be
put
in
more
technical
terms
as
a
question
of
how
much
melanin
our
bodies
produce
and
maintain
as
part
of
our
epidermic
structure
As
a
disabled
person
who
spent
the
first
four
years
of
their
recovery
from
a
debilitating
injury
single
and
who
has
many
beloved
single
disabled
friends
I
am
obsessed
with
articles
that
explore
care
work
outside
romantic
relationships
I
ve
read
Caleb
Luna
s
iconic
essay
Romantic
Love
is
Killing
Us
Who
Takes
Care
of
Us
When
We
re
Single
more
times
than
I
can
count
and
about
10
books
on
the
future
of
care
In
2021
Oliver
Haug
added
to
the
conversation
in
this
critical
essay
that
explores
this
important
issue
in
light
of
the
pandemic
After
a
year
that
s
laid
painfully
bare
inequities
and
oppressions
that
have
always
been
there
the
systemic
change
that
s
at
the
core
of
rewriting
love
still
feels
far
out
of
reach
…
The
way
out
offered
by
Luna
and
Kim
as
well
as
many
others
working
in
this
field
is
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
necessity
of
interdependence
in
relationships
beyond
our
romantic
ones
With
a
restructuring
of
romantic
love
as
comparable
to
community/platonic/self-love
we
begin
to
prioritize
the
care
and
livelihood
of
entire
larger
groups
of
people
as
equally
important
as
our
romantic
partner/s
writes
Luna
There
are
few
outlets
that
cover
fatphobia
as
well
as
Bitch
Magazine
did
But
then
a
feminist
magazine
that
purports
to
engage
in
cultural
criticism
that
didn
t
respond
to
fatphobia
wouldn
t
be
doing
its
job
well
Claudia
Cortese
s
essay
tackles
the
widespread
effort
by
public
health
officials
to
restrict
or
prohibit
fat
or
disabled
people
from
accessing
the
limited
supply
of
ventilators
during
COVID-19
waves
The
piece
does
the
important
work
of
exploring
the
deadly
impact
of
fatphobia
Some
doctors
not
only
have
an
aversion
to
patients
of
size
but
they
assume
a
fat
body
is
inherently
a
sick
body
this
mode
of
thinking
encourages
health
professionals
to
overlook
symptoms
of
disease
not
offer
treatment
and
focus
solely
on
ridding
the
body
of
fat
For
example
a
2015
study
of
medical
students
found
they
were
nearly
four
times
more
likely
to
prescribe
medication
to
thin
patients
than
to
fat
patients
though
both
groups
had
the
same
symptoms
The
supposed
relationship
between
fatness
and
health
concerns
likely
exists
due
to
widespread
weight
bias
While
it
seems
that
more
people
know
about
prison
abolitionism
these
days
in
2015
that
wasn
t
the
case

Octavia

Imarisha

power
of

while
weaving
in
the
visionary
words
of
Ursula
K
Le

Arundhati
Roy
Audre
Lorde
and
others
It
is
an
inspiring
essay
that
makes
you
rethink
both
what
social
justice
organizing
and
speculative
fiction
are
and
do
We
started
the
anthology
with
the
belief
that
all
organizing
is
science
fiction
When
we
talk
about
a
world
without
prisons
a
world
without
police
violence
a
world
where
everyone
has
food
clothing
shelter
quality
education
a
world
free
of
white
supremacy
patriarchy
capitalism
heterosexism
we
are
talking
about
a
world
that
doesn
t
currently
exist
But
collectively
dreaming
up
one
that
does
means
we
can
begin
building
it
into
existence
These
days
everything
s
coming
up
labor
rights
Part
of
what
s
fueling
the
renewed
move
toward
unionism
is
social
media
Sophie
Hayssen
explores
the
ways
Instagram
accounts
are
functioning
like
second-wave
feminist
consciousness-raising
groups
by
talking
about
things
many
people
don
t
feel
comfortable
broaching
to

unsafe
work

Bitch

s
coverage
of

the
stories
of
people
struggling
for
justice
in
industries
as
diverse
as
the

industry
the

sector
nonprofits
and

these

of
the
American

what

how

that
she
presented
a
very
different
example
of
a
girl
than
what
I
was
used
to
seeing
in
cartoons
I
also
loved
that
she
wanted
to
right
wrongs
and
understood
her
desire
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
I
really
love
this
piece
by
Soleil
Ho
who
writes
about
her
own
ambivalent
feelings
about
girlhood
and
Girl
Power
and
her
turn
to
Sailor
Moon
for
a
glimpse
into
a
beautifully
imperfect
heroine
I
realize
now
that
being
a
girl
or
identifying
as
one
is
one
of
the
hardest
roles
to
inhabit
in
this
world
A
girl
is
supposed
to
be
so
many
things
attractive
graceful
polite
quiet
valuable
valueless
but
none
of
those
traits
guarantee
that
she
ll
be
taken
seriously
as
a
thinking
and
feeling
human
being
On
the
other
hand
the
absence
of
those
traits
can
often
invite
violence
or
at
the
very
least
judgment
When
we
say
that
all
girls
are
powerful
we
often
refrain
from
explaining
just
what
kind
of
power
we
re
talking
about
The
power
that
I
want
girls
to
have
certainly
includes
the
power
to
govern
their
own
bodies
but
also
something
else
entirely
Sailor
Moon
isn
t
just
fighting
aliens
but
a
world
of
adults
who
want
to
destroy
everything
beautiful
in
girls
In
order
to
save
the
people
she
loves
she
fights
and
gets
hurt
and
breaks
down
and
even
completely
fails
at
times
And
when
she
can
manage
it
she
tries
to
save
the
monsters
too
In
this
powerful
exploration
of
trans
women
s
writing
Katherine
Cross
discusses
how
work
emerging
at
the
time
the
piece
was
written
was
full
of
joy
love
laughter
sex
and
deep
wells
of
human
flourishing
amid
the
gloom
It
highlights
writers
like
Casey
Plett
Sybil
Lamb
and
Olympia
Perez
and
talks
about
writing
that
paints
a
picture
of
the
everyday
experiences
of
trans
women
that
isn
t
inspiration
porn
or
a
feel-good
story
of
triumph
over
lone
bigots
Just
read
the
piece
Then
read
the
works
it
cites
This
is
trans
women
s
moment
in
modern
literature
and
amid
the
many
currents
of
transgender
existence
today
it
is
singular
So
much
discourse
around
trans
women
s
existence
has
been
spun
by
everyone
but
us
cisgender
male
psychologists
cis
feminist
academics
trans
men
and
queer
cis
people
All
have
had
their
say
about
our
lives
and
what
they
supposedly
signify
to
them
protean
radicalism
a
crypto-conservative
conspiracy
a
tangle
of
pathology
But
it
is
very
rare
that
trans
women
themselves
are
heard
when
we
speak
about
who
we
are
and
what
we
mean
What
emerges
from
all
of
these
works
is
a
clear
picture
of
trans
women
as
human
beings
thinkers
and
artists
with
mastery
and
control
over
the
kinds
of
stories
they
wish
to
tell
Neither
genderfucking
superheroines
nor
the
nightmare
of
queer
radicalism
we
are
at
last
human
At
a
time
when
trans-exclusionary
radical
feminists
are
resurging
I
wanted
to
return
to
this
article
by
Tina
Vasquez
which
talks
about
the
history
of
trans
exclusion
in
feminist
movements
and
calls
on
cisgender
feminists
to
take
more
responsibility
for
fighting
transphobia
That
s
the
thing
about
Bitch
It
wasn
t
just
a
magazine
that
asked
us
to
think
only
of
our
own
liberation
it
asked
its
readers
to
think
about
how
we
could
fight
for
each
other
s
freedom
The
magazine
made
all
its
readers
better
feminists
by
teaching
us
how
to
be
better
allies
to
each
other
Trans
women
have
been
saddled
with
the
responsibility
of
taking
on
trans-exclusionary
feminists
for
far
too
long—but
it
s
not
their
issue
to
deal
with
alone
Cisgender
feminists
such
as
myself
have
to
make
it
clear
that
our
feminism
loves
and
supports
trans
women
and
that
we
will
fight
against
transphobia
As
Williams
said
it
s
time
to
expose
trans-exclusionary
feminists
for
who
they
really
are

Brendan
O
Meara
is
no
stranger
to
talking
about
the
art
and
craft
of
storytelling
In
this
craft-focused
excerpt
we
re
digging
into
Episode
313
in
which
he
interviewed
Atavist
editor-in-chief
Seyward
Darby
and
writer
Katia
Savchuk
about
their
work
on
the
latest
issue
of
The
Atavist
Why
don
t
we
copy
the
work
of
writers
we
admire
more
Don
t
plagiarize
duh
but
when
it
comes
to
practicing
our
scales
why
aren
t
we
retyping
more
work
of
the
masters
After
all
the
masters
did
this
Hunter
S
Thompson
famously
typed
up
the
work
of
F
Scott
Fitzgerald
Ernest
Hemingway
and
William
Faulkner
Joan
Didion
did
the
same
Now
add
to
that
list
Katia
Savchuk
the
freelance
journalist
who
wrote
The
Atavist
s
latest
feature
A
Crime
Beyond
Belief
Katia
who
s
based
in
the
Bay
Area
routinely
copies
the
work
of
the
New
Yorker
writer
David
Grann
someone
she
greatly
admires
I
found
it
to
be
an
amazing
practice
she
says
First
of
all
it
gets
your
hands
flowing
the
words
flowing
instead
of
just
sitting
down
with
your
own
text
a
blank
page
It
s
almost
like
running
a
few
laps
to
give
your
fingers
something
to
do
Before
my
conversation
with
Katia
Atavist
editor-in-chief
Seyward
Darby
speaks
of
wrangling
in
Katia
s
piece
a
19,000-word
story
that
demanded
a
tricky
structure
The
key
wasn
t
merely
organization
but
pace
trying
to
think
about
how
we
can
order
…
the
story
such
that
the
reader
never
feels
like
‘
I
have
everything
I
came
for
why
are
there
still
10,000
words
left
Figuring
out
that
structure
where
things
didn
t
really
feel
front-loaded
was
maybe
the
most
important
decision
we
had
to
make
And
later
Katia
digs
into
how
she
kept
it
all
straight
the
transcripts
the
photos
her
notes
everything
to
tackle
this
ambitious
riveting
account
of
a
series
of
bizarre
home
invasions
and
the
Harvard-trained
lawyer
convicted
of
committing
them
A
Crime
Beyond
Belief
was
more
than
four
years
in
the
making
so
please
enjoy
this

These
interviews
have
been
edited
for
clarity
and
concision
Brendan
O
Meara
What
really
struck
you
about
Katia
s
story
when
it
came
across
your
desk
Seyward
Darby
The
story
s
about
a
kidnapping
that
police
in
Vallejo
California
initially
said
was
a
hoax
It
was
sensational
at
the
time
It
was
in
the
national
news
wound
up
on
Dateline
and
Nancy
Grace
all
that
kind
of
stuff
And
so
we
re
not
the
first
to
tell
the
story
But
what
Katia
has
done
here
is
gone
deep
into
what
happened
who
was
involved
and
how
so
many
things
went
wrong
but
then
ultimately
were
also
made
right
We
wanted
to
take
the
readers
on
a
revelatory
journey
to
go
along
with
some
of
the
characters
as
they
encountered
information
and
had
to
decide
what
was
true
and
what
wasn
t
So
there
s
a
little
bit
of
puzzle-piecing
that
the
piece
itself
shows
happening
It
s
a
really
complicated
twisty
piece
and
definitely
one
where
structure
was
not
a
given
When
she
turned
in
the
first
draft
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
kind
of
staring
at
it
and
writing
notes
on
Post-its
and
trying
to
think
about
how
we
can
order
them
in
the
story
such
that
the
reader
never
feels
like
I
have
everything
I
came
for
why
are
there
still
10,000
words
left
Figuring
out
that
structure
where
things
didn
t
really
feel
front-loaded
was
maybe
the
most
important
decision
we
had
to
make
Trying
to
figure
out
you
know
how
to
not
just
organize
things
but
pace
things
Pace
was
just
really
really
crucial
here
Anytime
that
a
reporter
is
brought
into
a
story
as
a
character
I
always
love
reading
that
dynamic
and
how
a
reporter
is
writing
about
a
reporter
in
a
story
like
this
Henry
Lee
the
San
Francisco
Chronicle
reporter
is
such
an
interesting
subject
A
lot
of
the
events
in
the
story
for
the
most
part
went
down
in
2015
And
he
says
you
know
we
were
kind
of
just
at
the
beginning
of
a
reckoning
about
law
enforcement
and
how
to
approach
them
as
reporters
The
other
thing
that
s
really
important
to
remember
here
is
How
often
do
you
hear
cops
publicly
say
something
like
we
think
this
kidnapping
was
a
hoax
Lee
points
out
that
that
s
just
an
insane
thing
to
claim
and
have
it
not
be
true
That
s
definitely
a
tension
in
the
piece
once
you
know
everything
you
re
like
how
could
they
ever
say
that
it
was
a
hoax
But
if
you
re
on
the
receiving
end
of
that
information
I
don
t
know
if
we
would
call
it
a
biased
assumption
or
a
human
assumption
but
you
think
well
that
has
to
be
true
Like
why
else
would
they
claim
something
so
outlandish
That
s
obviously
a
flaw
but
it
s
an
interesting
one
because
I
do
think
that
there
are
moments
in
the
story
where
you
know
as
journalists
you
can
take
a
step
back
and
say
Well
yeah
I
guess
I
get
why
that
might
happen
Several
years
ago
I
pitched
a
story
to
you
for
The
Atavist
and
I
remember
you
coming
at
me
like
this
feels
like
there
should
be
a
Big
Fish
element
to
it
You
brought
that
movie
sensibility
to
it
which
I
thought
was
really
intriguing
I
bring
that
up
only
to
say
that
in
this
piece
there
was
this
Gone
Girl
element
that
was
dropped
into
this
piece
and
it
made
me
wonder
if
you
d
put
that
on
Katia
s
radar
Maybe
you
could
speak
to
how
sometimes
you
use
those
movies
as
a
way
to
crack
the
code
of
a
piece
that
s
coming
across
your
desk
That
s
a
great
question
In
this
case
I
didn
t
have
to
bring
up
Gone
Girl
because
the
police
were
the
ones
who
brought
up
Gone
Girl
They
were
the
ones
who
were
telling
this
woman
s
family
before
she
had
been
returned
by
the
kidnapper
we
think
this
is
being
faked
You
should
go
watch
Gone
Girl
which
had
just
come
out
a
couple
of
months
prior
the
David
Fincher
adaptation
of
the
Gillian
Flynn
book
Nancy
Grace
called
her
the
real-life
Gone
Girl
or
something
along
those
lines
In
that
case
the
cinematic
story
was
almost
part
of
the
problem
right
People
looked
at
the
situation
and
for
whatever
reason
decided
okay
we
actually
think
the
thing
that
s
happening
in
real
life
sounds
a
whole
lot
like
this
thing
in
a
book
And
so
we
re
gon
na
start
calling
it
that
And
that
obviously
did
a
tremendous
disservice
to
the
couple
at
the
heart
of
this
entire
story
But
you
re
absolutely
right
Oftentimes
I
m
thinking
through
stories
and
thinking
how
can
we
make
this
more
cinematic
As
you
were
asking
the
question
I
was
like
What
movie
would
I
compare
the
story
to
as
Katia
put
it
together
I
m
gon
na
have
to
think
about
that
for
a
second
Maybe
by
the
end
of
us
talking
I
ll
have
a
good
comparison
I
know
it
doesn
t
run
backwards
but
in
a
sense
because
it
s
a
slow
exposure
like
a
Polaroid
coming
into
focus
it
kind
of
makes
me
think
of
Memento
I
think
describing
it
as
like
a
Polaroid
coming
into
focus
is
absolutely
right
That
s
definitely
the
vibe
we
were
going
for
in
working
on
the
story
from
a
structural
standpoint
building
tension
doing
some
jump
cuts
We
wanted
it
to
feel
like
the
reader
would
start
to
see
things
clearly
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
subjects
in
the
story
are
starting
to
see
things
clearly
And
then
some
of
them
never
did
Matthew
Muller
who
is
now
convicted
of
this
crime
doesn
t
necessarily
see
it
yet
Maybe
he
never
will
because
of
the
mental
illness
that
he
s
afflicted
with
But
then
there
are
some
other
really
interesting
questions
that
she
gets
into
at
the
end
about
how
there
are
other
people
affected
by
the
events
who
still
have
questions
about
what
did
or
didn
t
happen
Even
when
things
might
seem
settled
to
some
parties
involved
in
a
situation
to
others
reality
can
still
feel
somewhat
out
of
reach
I
don
t
know
if
the
Polaroid
is
quite
in
focus
for
everyone
involved
Something
I
ve
noticed
over
the
course
of
several
Atavist
stories
is
that
the
first
two-thirds
or
three-quarters
is
often
if
not
exclusively
third-person
and
then
in
that
final
chapter
or
the
final
quarter
or
maybe
even
just
an
epilogue
we
see
the
reporter
come
in
What
is
it
about
that
particular
structuring
that
appeals
to
you
I
d
never
thought
of
it
as
a
pattern
but
I
guess
it
is
to
a
certain
extent
and
on
maybe
a
certain
type
of
story
When
you
re
talking
about
the
types
of
stories
we
do
that
introduce
a
lot
of
these
gigantic
questions
and
when
you
get
to
the
end
there
s
a
bit
of
a
what
does
it
all
mean
and
I
think
sometimes
the
reporter
can
be
a
helpful
prism
for
starting
to
tie
some
of
those
things
together
I
d
like
to
think
that
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
last
passage
of
a
piece
our
writers
have
really
earned
the
trust
of
readers
So
when
they
do
become
the
prism
for
thinking
about
the
story
in
its
totality
the
reader
almost
feels
like
Oh
good
okay
now
they
re
here
It
definitely
doesn
t
work
in
every
story
And
I
wouldn
t
ever
want
to
put
it
in
every
story
But
I
do
feel
like
there
are
stories
where
I
want
to
know
what
the
reporter
thinks
I
want
to
see
the
reporter
in
this
case
talk
to
Mathew
Muller
over
the
course
of
four
years
I
don
t
think
it
s
a
conscious
decision
where
we
sit
down
and
say
Is
this
the
kind
of
piece
where
at
the
end
we
re
gon
na
go
in
the
first
person
And
certainly
there
are
stories
where
there
s
some
first
person
throughout
and
there
are
other
stories
where
some
first
person
comes
in
you
know
much
earlier
But
some
of
these
pieces
that
feel
like
they
have
lingering
loose
threads
sometimes
having
the
writer
there
to
navigate
that
can
be
a
good
way
to
wrap
things
up
I
liken
it
to
a
whodunit
And
at
the
very
end
Hercule
Poirot
is
going
to
come
in
he
s
going
to
sum
everything
up
he
s
going
to
answer
some
questions
It
s
relieving
some
of
the
pressure
it
s
bringing
some
new
light
it
almost
grounds
it
Like
I
feel
like
my
feet
are
back
on
the
ground
when
the
reporter
comes
in
to
show
the
work
and
show
some
interaction
and
raise
some
questions
that
sometimes
we
don
t
even
know
the
answers
to
Obviously
there
are
still
people
who
say
don
t
bring
yourself
as
a
journalist
into
magazine
reporting
unless
it
s
a
first-person
story
of
some
kind
I
just
feel
like
when
you
re
talking
about
these
really
rangy
pieces
you
want
it
to
feel
grounded
in
the
end
It
s
something
that
you
get
more
of
in
podcasting
because
obviously
you
re
hearing
the
host
you
much
more
feel
like
you
re
in
some
kind
of
relationship
You
re
letting
them
into
your
head
and
the
reporter
becomes
a
way
for
listeners
to
have
access
to
certain
questions
or
certain
issues
or
whatever
it
may
be
And
as
far
as
I
m
concerned
it
can
work
in
writing
as
well
at
least
it
doesn
t
just
have
to
be
audio-driven
I
hate
the
first-person
stuff
where
it
ll
start
off
like
Matthew
McConaughey
was
eating
steak
tartare
and
I
walked
up
to
him
But
we
don
t
have
to
worry
about
that
with
the
Atavist
stuff
because
you
guys
handle
it
so
well
Although
now
I
feel
like
I
m
just
gon
na
do
that
at
some
point
just
to
make
you
angry
So
I
m
working
on
an
essay
about
the
pros
and
cons
of
voice
recorders
and
tape
recorders
John
McPhee
never
uses
them
at
all
he
thinks
that
even
though
they
capture
everything
they
re
not
selective
And
he
trusts
that
when
he
s
taking
notes
he
s
getting
the
best
stuff
But
at
the
same
time
sometimes
your
penmanship
can
fail
you
And
by
not
capturing
everything
you
re
not
getting
the
exact
thing
down
It
s
a
conundrum
But
I
m
very
romantically
tied
to
the
idea
of
like
just
pencil
and
notebook
How
do
you
feel
about
it
Katia
Savchuk
Yeah
I
don
t
think
I
could
operate
like
that
because
I
d
be
too
focused
on
what
am
I
missing
Get
that
down
Remember
that
I
d
like
to
know
that
there
s
a
machine
going
in
the
background
Sometimes
you
don
t
know
what
s
going
to
be
important
until
later
Also
when
you
interview
other
people
you
learn
other
things
and
you
connect
dots
that
you
wouldn
t
have
otherwise
So
I
always
record
and
take
notes
I
m
taking
notes
on
the
ambient
details
what
someone
s
expression
looks
like
what
s
on
the
wall
those
kinds
of
things
I
trust
the
machine
to
be
getting
down
the
exact
quotes
A
long
time
ago
I
was
using
a
recorder
and
talking
to
a
horse
trainer
In
the
background
you
could
hear
blue
jays
chirping
and
that
ended
up
being
a
little
detail
I
was
able
to
fold
in
to
the
particular
chapter
I
was
writing
It
just
added
that
extra
layer
of
flavor
that
I
wouldn
t
have
been
able
to
get
if
I
was
just
scribbling
like
crazy
trying
to
keep
up
with
what
he
was
saying
I
mean
there
s
obviously
so
much
to
be
said
for
interviewing
in
person
The
trust
that
s
built
the
things
you
notice
But
there
s
also
something
I
enjoy
about
doing
interviews
over
the
phone
because
I
usually
try
to
type
in
real
time
First
of
all
it
kind
of
saves
you
time
I
have
an
in-ear
Olympus
ear
bud
recorder
and
I
m
also
typing
at
the
same
time
in
this
tool
called
Pear
Note
Then
once
I
m
done
recording
I
can
import
the
audio
and
I
link
them
So
then
you
can
press
play
in
Pear
Note
and
you
hear
that
part
of
the
tape
So
that
really
helped
with
fact-checking
the
story
I
know
Top
Chef
has
been
on
for
like
19
seasons
but
my
wife
and
I
just
discovered
it
On
the
latest
episode
one
of
the
judges
said
your
plate
has
to
have
like
authorship
and
another
said
you
have
to
edit
your
plate
And
I
was
like
oh
cooking
and
writing
are
coming
together
You
have
to
have
that
voice
and
how
you
have
to
think
about
what
to
leave
in
and
what
to
leave
out
Maybe
it
s
not
cooking
but
are
there
any
other
artistic
media
that
really
help
you
become
a
better
writer
I
do
love
dancing
as
a
hobby
and
not
in
any
way
professionally
But
it
s
something
I
ve
been
doing
for
a
long
time
just
for
fun
And
there
are
lots
of
elements
especially
for
people
who
take
it
seriously
it
s
practicing
it
s
getting
better
over
time
Like
the
Ira
Glass
quote
If
you
have
good
taste
you
won
t
be
meeting
your
own
standards
early
on
You
really
just
have
to
plow
through
that
and
get
a
little
bit
closer
and
a
little
bit
closer
But
what
I
ve
been
thinking
about
lately
is
the
sense
of
play
that
I
get
from
dancing
Like
I
approach
it
from
a
total
place
of
this
is
just
for
fun
to
unwind
I
don
t
have
anything
wrapped
up
in
it
around
I
want
to
be
the
best
I
want
this
dance
to
be
perfect
There
s
nothing
like
that
So
I
ve
been
trying
to
see
ways
that
I
can
bring
some
more
of
that
sense
of
play
into
work
A
lot
of
the
work
is
really
serious
and
important
and
depending
on
the
story
you
re
writing
about
real
people
and
their
lives
But
whether
it
s
at
the
sentence
level
or
free
writing
or
feeling
a
sense
of
play
when
you
re
coming
up
with
ideas
that
s
something
I
m
working
on
When
we
were
kids
even
in
middle
or
high
school
when
you
were
told
to
write
a
story
you
just
wanted
to
have
fun
with
it
and
write
the
thing
and
you
didn
t
care
if
it
sucked
or
won
an
award
or
all
these
things
that
we
attach
our
prestige
and
status
to
and
you
just
did
it
because
it
was
a
fun
creative
outlet
We
often
get
so
earnest
with
our
writing
and
our
work
We
just
attach
too
much
doom
and
gloom
to
it
you
know
the
tortured
writer
so
it
s
great
to
hear
you
talk
about
play
I
love
that
And
I
was
one
of
those
people
who
started
on
the
middle
school
newspaper
and
all
through
high
school
So
I
definitely
try
to
tap
in
as
much
as
I
can
to
that
spirit
On
your
website
you
write
that
you
re
a
proud
generalist
often
drawn
to
stories
about
inequality
psychology
wrongdoing
and
mysteries
of
all
kinds
How
did
you
arrive
at
that
in
your
journalism
I
added
that
line
not
too
long
ago
actually
I
hear
so
much
about
you
need
a
niche
And
it
certainly
can
be
helpful
but
it
s
just
something
that
doesn
t
work
for
me
One
thing
I
love
about
being
a
journalist
and
especially
a
freelancer
is
getting
to
follow
your
curiosity
and
learn
about
so
many
different
things
I
used
to
work
at
Forbes
magazine
for
the
wealth
team
There
s
a
lot
that
falls
under
that
as
it
s
probably
the
broadest
team
but
as
you
move
up
it
tends
to
get
more
and
more
specialized
and
that
just
wasn
t
what
I
wanted
to
do
But
I
did
sort
of
try
to
think
about
what
are
the
themes
in
my
work
What
am
I
generally
drawn
to
I
love
investigative
stories
and
have
a
bit
of
background
in
investigative
reporting
and
always
drawn
to
public
interest
issues
But
I
also
have
this
love
of
mystery
You
worked
as
a
private
investigator
too
In
what
way
has
that
helped
you
as
a
reporter
It
was
probably
a
lot
less
exciting
than
it
sounds
I
wasn
t
tailing
people
on
the
street
looking
for
cheating
husbands
or
anything
It
was
a
private
investigative
firm
and
a
lot
of
what
they
did
was
background
checks
and
investigations
that
are
part
of
lawsuits
They
did
do
exciting
work
but
a
lot
of
it
had
to
do
with
databases
and
knowing
how
to
use
those
to
find
information
I
loved
working
there
It
was
some
of
the
smartest
people
I
ve
ever
worked
with
and
I
loved
doing
investigative
work
It
was
just
that
the
end
product
would
be
this
memo
that
would
go
to
whoever
commissioned
it
at
the
law
firm
or
the
partners
at
some
hedge
fund
or
something
and
then
it
d
be
like
this
great
story
[
that
]
nobody
would
really
see
So
I
just
really
wanted
someone
to
read
it
and
that
creative
aspect
was
equally
important
to
me
I
do
wish
I
still
had
all
those
databases
but
they
re
expensive
And
you
know
you
have
to
be
licensed
In
the
Venn
diagram
of
all
those
things
that
you
re
interested
in
this
Atavist
piece
kind
of
encapsulates
a
whole
lot
wrongdoing
psychology
inequality
mystery
it
s
right
there
How
did
you
arrive
at
this
story
It
was
pretty
mainstream
at
the
time
but
then
stuck
with
it
and
told
something
that
is
wholly
and
uniquely
you
I
found
out
about
it
in
the
news
like
everybody
else
It
was
in
the
news
in
2015
obviously
because
the
police
initially
called
the
main
crime
I
write
about
a
hoax
The
word
that
everybody
uses
is
bizarre
which
it
certainly
was
so
it
caught
my
eye
but
I
was
working
at
Forbes
at
the
time
and
it
wasn
t
something
that
would
fall
into
their
coverage
area
Not
too
long
after
I
went
freelance
in
2017
the
victims
sued
the
city
of
Vallejo
California
and
ended
up
winning
a
settlement
and
so
it
was
back
in
the
headlines
I
was
like
oh
yeah
that
story
is
just
fascinating
somebody
must
have
already
written
the
magazine
version
of
it
And
I
looked
and
they
hadn
t
I
thought
somebody
must
be
currently
writing
a
magazine
version
of
it
but
why
don
t
I
just
give
it
a
shot
So
I
reached
out
to
a
lot
of
the
people
involved
and
then
went
from
there
It
s
funny
hearing
you
say
that
because
sometimes
I
come
up
with
ideas
and
think
This
is
great
but
if
I
came
up
with
it
someone
else
must
have
by
now
and
it
s
not
even
worth
pursuing
And
so
much
of
the
time
it
turns
out
to
be
true
There
are
things
that
are
in
the
zeitgeist
and
people
who
are
magazine
writers
see
all
the
elements
But
sometimes
it
s
the
ones
that
are
in
plain
sight
[
that
work
out
]
I
m
sure
a
lot
of
people
did
reach
out
to
them
but
they
probably
couldn
t
get
access
right
away
Nobody
wanted
to
talk
in
the
early
days
A
few
years
after
the
main
events
since
the
initial
media
circus
they
were
maybe
a
little
bit
more
receptive
Access
is
such
a
tricky
thing
of
course
to
tell
these
kinds
of
stories
and
in
getting
that
kind
of
trust
And
sometimes
just
getting
that
first
cold
email
the
first
cold
call
to
land
because
that
s
the
one
that
can
start
the
momentum
What
becomes
that
first
lead
domino
as
you
re
trying
to
build
sources
for
a
story
this
ambitious
The
first
thing
I
did
was
to
reach
out
to
the
victims
in
the
main
case
that
I
m
writing
about
Denise
Huskins
and
Aaron
Quinn
This
story
is
in
the
Bay
Area
which
is
where
I
live
so
I
figured
out
that
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
criminal
defense
attorney
has
come
across
their
criminal
defense
attorney
so
maybe
we
can
talk
about
why
they
had
one
which
is
obviously
because
they
weren
t
initially
believed
So
I
wrote
to
her
and
she
was
willing
to
pass
on
my
email
to
their
attorney
who
was
willing
to
pass
on
my
email
to
them
So
we
ended
up
corresponding
a
little
bit
and
then
meeting
in
person
just
to
kind
of
feel
each
other
out
Sometimes
I
like
to
say
let
s
meet
with
no
commitments
so
they
don
t
feel
like
they
re
signing
on
to
anything
But
this
was
obviously
a
very
traumatic
and
personal
story
for
them
And
a
lot
of
people
had
reached
out
to
them
So
they
wanted
to
see
you
know
do
they
feel
comfortable
and
trust
me
and
so
I
drove
to
where
they
live
And
we
had
a
great
conversation
But
then
the
next
day
they
said
actually
we
re
signing
a
book
deal
with
an
NDA
so
we
won
t
be
talking
to
you
The
book
ended
up
coming
out
which
was
essentially
an
extended
interview
it
was
really
their
story
in
their
voice
And
then
later
I
ended
up
interviewing
them
as
well
They
also
gave
extended
testimony
in
court
about
what
happened
to
them
In
terms
of
the
man
who
was
convicted
of
the
crime
there
was
one
family
friend
who
was
quoted
in
all
the
news
stories
and
I
found
him
on
Facebook
I
think
and
I
reached
out
to
him
because
he
was
kind
of
acting
as
a
spokesperson
for
the
family
I
just
said
something
along
the
lines
of
a
lot
of
people
are
probably
reaching
out
to
you
and
I
gave
my
impression
of
what
the
coverage
had
been
so
far
And
in
this
case
it
really
did
seem
one-dimensional
in
terms
of
the
man
involved
who
is
the
ex-Marine
Harvard-trained
lawyer
who
did
pro
bono
work
for
most
of
his
life
and
then
ended
up
being
convicted
of
these
pretty
bizarre
crimes
Some
of
the
news
articles
had
mentioned
almost
in
passing
that
he
has
bipolar
disorder
he
struggles
with
mental
illness
but
it
was
just
kind
of
a
throwaway
thing
and
it
didn
t
really
come
up
in
his
court
case
either
And
it
s
a
federal
court
case
That
s
not
to
excuse
anything
that
he
did
but
everyone
is
three-dimensional
how
does
somebody
go
from
A
to
B
What
role
did
mental
illness
play
How
was
that
for
his
family
to
watch
and
be
part
of
So
I
reached
out
to
them
and
told
them
that
my
intention
was
really
to
go
deeper
than
any
of
the
headlines
had
done
not
to
do
anything
sensational
but
really
try
to
understand
his
life
as
a
whole
and
write
a
more
nuanced
thorough
piece
and
that
I
was
willing
to
put
in
the
time
to
do
it
and
find
a
publication
that
would
edit
it
with
that
perspective
as
well
How
did
you
develop
that
degree
of
empathy
to
bring
that
to
your
reporting
so
you
can
get
to
that
nuance
and
beyond
the
headlines
I
don
t
know
if
you
develop
empathy
I
mean
I
think
to
be
a
magazine
writer
you
have
to
have
empathy
You
spend
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
get
inside
a
person
s
mind
in
a
way
If
it
s
a
case
of
wrongdoing
then
you
have
empathy
for
the
people
that
are
the
victims
of
whatever
it
is
But
usually
there
s
no
100
%
clear
victims
and
villains
In
this
case
and
again
not
to
excuse
what
he
did
but
Mathew
Muller
himself
said
if
I
m
dangerous
I
should
be
behind
bars
But
in
many
ways
he
was
also
a
victim
of
psychosis
and
certain
systems
that
told
him
that
it
wasn
t
okay
to
reveal
that
Like
the
military
like
the
legal
profession
or
a
father
who
was
kind
of
a
coach-type
figure
with
a
tough-it-out
mentality
These
were
all
reasons
he
didn
t
want
to
speak
out
when
he
started
running
into
troubles
with
delusion
That
s
why
I
love
magazine
writing
It
lets
you
give
all
the
context
and
the
nuance
that
really
is
there
whenever
humans
are
involved
Do
you
find
a
way
to
integrate
some
sort
of
a
pressure
valve
into
your
reporting
given
how
deep
you
can
go
with
people
talking
about
sometimes
very
disturbing
dramatic
things
So
you
don
t
take
on
too
much
of
what
you
re
reporting
on
I
think
there
are
so
many
other
people
out
there
doing
work
that
is
so
much
more
dramatic
the
people
on
the
frontline
in
Ukraine
right
now
certainly
In
this
particular
case
a
lot
of
the
interviews
were
pretty
spread
out
Some
of
the
interviews
were
pretty
intensive
like
five
hours
long
at
a
time
but
they
were
spread
out
over
time
And
with
Matt
Muller
we
did
a
lot
of
our
interviews
over
video
conference
in
the
jail
they
don
t
allow
in-person
visitors
in
the
jail
even
for
family
which
is
kind
of
crazy
that
somebody
wouldn
t
see
another
living
person
But
they
were
limited
to
half
an
hour
at
a
time
in
those
in
those
interviews
So
it
was
pretty
broken
up
I
don
t
think
I
have
any
revolutionary
coping
mechanisms
Dance
helps
taking
a
walk
I
have
an
accountability
buddy
Jaeah
Lee
another
freelancer
here
in
the
Bay
Area
who
is
an
amazing
reporter
and
writer
and
we
check
in
weekly
and
we
ve
done
that
pretty
much
for
the
last
four
years
I
think
that
really
helps
it
s
like
having
a
colleague
a
sort
of
home
base
that
you
can
run
things
by
wins
challenges
just
bounce
anything
off
of
The
story
is
practically
20,000
words
As
a
writer
it
s
a
lot
to
get
your
head
around
How
did
you
go
about
organizing
your
reporting
material
so
that
you
had
access
to
the
things
that
you
wanted
to
draw
from
I
definitely
don
t
think
I
could
write
a
long
piece
without
Scrivener
at
this
point
What
I
usually
do
and
did
in
this
case
is
just
tried
to
put
everything
in
there
I
tried
to
map
out
what
the
sections
were
going
to
be
and
I
created
a
folder
there
for
each
section
and
tried
to
put
everything
I
had
in
that
folder
photos
interview
transcripts
court
records
In
Scrivener
you
can
do
a
split
screen
So
I
would
then
have
that
folder
open
and
whatever
document
I
was
looking
at
in
the
bottom
and
I
would
have
the
writing
window
at
the
top
That
s
usually
how
I
organize
things
I
m
naturally
a
disorganized
person
And
I
like
to
think
I
m
not
alone
in
that
I
ve
got
things
for
a
big
project
and
I
ve
got
it
by
year
in
folders
So
at
least
it
s
organized
like
that
But
I
m
sure
that
within
that
year
it
s
going
to
have
to
be
further
subdivided
So
I
m
always
curious
how
people
do
that
because
it
can
get
unwieldy
and
out
of
hand
and
then
like
this
Google
Drive
has
some
things
saved
here
but
then
this
one
over
here
has
some
other
things
I
mean
it
s
still
a
perennial
challenge
I
think
to
an
extent
I
was
organized
but
at
the
same
time
I
always
think
that
I
m
gon
na
write
down
as
I
m
writing
which
page
of
which
court
record
I
got
this
fact
so
that
when
fact-checking
comes
along
I
just
know
exactly
where
it
is
But
I
just
have
still
never
managed
to
do
that
you
know
because
when
you
re
writing
you
don
t
want
to
note
down
the
exact
page
number
always
Oh
I
ll
remember
to
do
it
I
ll
make
a
little
note
And
then
you
never
do
Yeah
But
I
will
say
another
thing
that
was
really
helpful
especially
in
this
story
was
having
a
timeline
in
a
spreadsheet
format
You
have
the
years
and
the
months
and
then
I
had
different
columns
for
the
different
characters
or
threads
that
I
was
following
So
there
s
one
for
Matt
Muller
s
world
the
world
of
Denise
and
Aaron
or
the
world
of
the
crime
and
the
investigation
and
putting
the
key
events
there
really
helps
Sometimes
you
draw
connections
that
way
oh
this
actually
just
happened
the
same
month
as
this
happened
so
it
helps
with
structuring
things
and
seeing
the
patterns
that
might
not
be
apparent
Speaking
of
structure
given
how
big
the
piece
is
it
s
always
a
challenge
to
have
the
requisite
tension
to
keep
people
reading
What
was
the
challenge
in
getting
your
head
around
the
structure
and
making
sure
that
requisite
tension
and
pacing
was
there
and
satisfying
I
give
a
lot
of
credit
to
Seyward
for
that
and
working
on
the
structure
with
me
Initially
it
seemed
like
the
structure
I
started
with
was
going
to
work
It
seemed
to
make
sense
to
start
with
the
main
crime
which
is
this
bizarre
kidnapping
that
happened
on
Mare
Island
in
Vallejo
in
2015
There
were
wetsuits
lasers
pre-recorded
messages
NyQuil
blood
pressure
cuffs
I
mean
there
s
a
lot
of
bizarre
details
which
you
could
read
about
in
the
story
but
it
just
seemed
to
make
sense
to
start
there
because
it
s
so
gripping
But
once
you
looked
at
the
story
as
a
whole
starting
there
ended
up
taking
some
of
the
air
out
of
it
If
you
build
to
that
crime
you
know
in
advance
what
s
going
to
happen
you
know
that
Matt
s
responsible
and
this
was
never
going
to
be
a
whodunit
A
lot
of
the
story
is
also
about
Matt
How
did
he
go
from
this
sort
of
model
citizen
for
lack
of
a
better
word
to
this
convicted
criminal
and
why
did
he
do
what
he
did
So
what
we
ended
up
doing
was
starting
with
this
raid
on
a
cabin
in
South
Lake
Tahoe
where
he
s
arrested
And
we
describe
a
crime
there
but
it
s
actually
not
that
crime
It
s
a
different
crime
We
see
the
cabin
and
we
see
all
these
bizarre
things
in
the
cabin
It
s
super-cluttered
like
a
hoarder
s
home
hair
dye
and
stun
gun
and
a
bunch
of
gloves
and
electronics
spray
paints
youcrime
scene
tape
a
penis
pump
You
re
like
what
happened
here
And
that
drives
the
mystery
a
little
bit
We
learn
that
he
s
arrested
And
then
we
re
like
Well
who
is
this
guy
And
how
did
he
get
there
But
also
near
the
end
of
the
first
section
a
detective
discovers
this
long
blonde
hair
And
none
of
the
victims
in
the
crime
that
we
just
learned
about
was
blonde
and
the
suspect
isn
t
blonde
So
then
we
hope
that
what
drives
a
good
portion
of
this
story
is
Whose
hair
is
that
And
then
the
tension
that
drives
another
good
portion
of
the
story
is
Was
this
crime
a
hoax
or
not
What
were
some
challenges
that
you
experienced
as
you
were
synthesizing
the
piece
There
were
quite
a
few
challenges
along
the
way
One
of
them
was
Matt
s
mental
state
As
I
mentioned
delusion
played
a
big
part
in
his
life
and
in
the
course
of
interviewing
him
when
we
first
got
in
touch
in
2018
he
was
in
a
federal
prison
and
then
he
got
moved
to
a
jail
here
in
Solano
County
his
mental
health
kind
of
fluctuated
So
trying
to
figure
out
is
he
or
is
he
not
in
a
state
of
mind
where
I
can
trust
what
he
s
saying
Does
he
trust
me
He
kept
pulling
out
because
paranoia
got
the
better
of
him
He
told
me
just
last
month
which
I
didn
t
know
before
that
he
thought
I
was
a
CIA
agent
Then
at
one
point
he
ended
up
being
deemed
incompetent
to
stand
trial
and
the
judge
ordered
that
he
should
get
anti-psychotic
medication
against
his
will
But
he
was
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
and
it
wasn
t
clear
when
or
if
he
would
be
restored
to
legal
competency
and
I
really
wasn
t
sure
how
we
were
going
to
fact-check
with
him
If
he
s
deemed
incompetent
to
stand
trial
it
really
doesn
t
feel
ethical
to
reach
out
to
him
because
he
might
say
something
that
he
wouldn
t
say
if
he
was
mentally
stable
and
it
might
be
incriminating
So
if
he
s
not
legally
competent
it
doesn
t
feel
like
he
would
be
competent
to
you
know
participate
in
an
interview
He
did
end
up
being
restored
to
legal
competency
and
we
did
fact-check
with
him
But
that
was
a
situation
I
had
never
encountered
before
The
piece
is
intense
Yeah
There
are
a
lot
of
twists
there
If
you
were
writing
it
as
a
novel
you
d
be
like
well
that
s
a
that
s
a
little
bit
too
convenient
For
example
the
lead
investigator
having
had
a
relationship
with
the
intended
target
of
the
kidnapping
who
is
also
the
ex-fiancée
of
the
victim
I
mean
it
s
very
odd
If
you
were
writing
a
novel
you
d
be
like
this
is
lazy
There
s
just
a
lot
of
things
that
feel
like
a
movie
which
is
the
theme
that
kept
coming
up
over
and
over
and
over
in
the
story
people
thinking
that
life
is
like
the
movies
and
then
realizing
that
it
s
not
At
the
end
of
these
conversations
I
typically
like
to
ask
guests
for
a
recommendation
of
some
kind
that
can
be
anything
from
something
professional
to
a
comfy
pair
of
socks
you
re
really
excited
about
Fanny
packs
Who
knows
So
what
would
you
recommend
for
the
listeners
out
there
I
would
recommend
a
practice
that
I
started
doing
this
year
that
I
always
meant
to
do
but
never
did
before
which
is
to
copy
the
work
of
your
idols
It
s
something
you
always
hear
about
like
Joan
Didion
did
that
artists
in
training
go
to
the
museum
and
copy
the
works
of
the
greats
So
it
s
something
that
I
always
thought
was
intriguing
But
I
actually
tried
it
this
year
And
I
started
with
David
Grann
s
work
who
is
one
of
my
heroes
He
has
written
a
lot
of
things
in
the
true
crime
genre
so
I
thought
it
was
a
good
one
I
ended
up
copying
his
stories
just
retyping
them
for
10
minutes
before
I
started
writing
for
the
day
And
I
found
it
to
be
an
amazing
practice
I
mean
first
of
all
it
like
gets
your
hands
just
flowing
like
the
words
flowing
instead
of
just
sitting
down
with
your
own
text
like
a
blank
page
It
s
almost
like
running
a
few
laps
to
give
your
fingers
something
to
do
Also
I
feel
like
you
pick
up
things
that
you
don
t
from
reading
alone
the
sort
of
decisions
on
a
sentence
level
that
a
writer
makes
I
found
it
to
be
really
inspiring
and
educational
and
also
kind
of
fun

Just
after
seven
in
the
morning
on
June
9
2015
Misty
Carausu
joined
a
group
of
police
officers
lining
up
outside
a
dark
green
cabin
with
white
trim
The
blinds
inside
were
drawn
Jeffrey
pines
cast
thick
shadows
across
the
driveway
The
air
was
still
but
for
the
scrape
of
boots
on
asphalt
and
the
occasional
call
of
a
bird
Carausu
35
was
at
least
a
head
shorter
than
the
other
officers
and
the
only
woman
She
wore
iridescent
eye
shadow
and
pearl
earrings
along
with
a
tactical
vest
As
she
gripped
her
gun
she
felt
as
if
she
d
stepped
into
one
of
the
true-crime
documentaries
she
binge-watched
at
night
It
was
Carausu
s
first
day
as
a
detective
En
route
to
the
scene
she
d
been
filled
in
on
the
case
Around
3:30
a.
m
the
previous
Friday
a
52-year-old
nurse
named
Lynn
Yen
who
lived
at
the
edge
of
Dublin
the
suburb
east
of
San
Francisco
where
Carausu
worked
had
called
911
Minutes
earlier
Lynn
and
her
60-year-old
husband
Chung
woke
to
a
flashlight
and
a
laser
shining
in
their
faces
A
masked
man
dressed
in
black
stood
at
the
foot
of
their
bed
We
have
your
daughter
and
she
s
safe
the
man
said
Kelly
22
had
been
in
her
bedroom
across
the
hall
Using
what
Lynn
described
as
a
calm
soft
voice
the
intruder
told
the
couple
to
turn
over
and
put
their
hands
behind
their
backs
Then
he
announced
that
he
would
tie
them
up
When
Chung
felt
the
man
touch
him
he
took
a
swing
Lynn
grabbed
her
phone
from
the
nightstand
locked
herself
in
the
bathroom
and
called
for
help
She
told
the
dispatcher
that
she
heard
fighting
then
her
husband
yell
Honey
go
get
the
gun
even
though
they
didn
t
own
one
A
few
minutes
later
the
intruder
fled
downstairs
and
out
the
back
door
which
opened
onto
miles
of
rolling
hills
and
open
fields
When
officers
arrived
at
the
scene
Chung
had
bruises
on
his
arms
and
face
and
was
bleeding
from
a
cut
above
his
ear—he
said
the
intruder
had
hit
him
with
a
metal
flashlight
A
window
near
the
back
door
was
open
and
the
screen
had
been
removed
In
the
couple
s
bedroom
police
found
a
black
wool
glove
and
three
plastic
zip
ties
On
a
gravel
path
behind
the
house
near
a
cluster
of
foxtails
officers
recovered
another
zip
tie
and
a
six-inch
shred
of
black
duct
tape
Kelly
who
was
unharmed
handed
a
sergeant
something
she
d
found
on
a
hallway
cabinet
near
her
room
a
cell
phone
she
didn
t
recognize
Police
later
traced
the
phone
number
to
the
cabin
Carausu
and
her
colleagues
were
now
preparing
to
enter
It
sat
on
a
residential
street
in
South
Lake
Tahoe
a
ski
resort
town
130
miles
from
Dublin
As
the
raid
began
Carausu
heard
the
cabin
s
front
door
splinter
Officers
barked
Search
warrant
as
they
shoved
through
a
barricade
of
chairs
Carausu
maneuvered
around
clutter
on
the
living
room
floor
a
set
of
crutches
license
plates
clothing
electronics
a
massage
table
Empty
boxes
were
piled
against
a
window
open
bottles
of
wine
and
cans
of
spray
paint
littered
the
kitchen
counters
Carausu
s
job
was
to
process
evidence
She
snapped
photos
of
a
black
ski
mask
black
duct
tape
and
mismatched
black
gloves
A
stun
gun
sat
on
a
rocking
chair
In
a
banker
s
box
she
found
more
duct
tape
and
gloves
along
with
walkie-talkies
a
radar
detector
zip
ties
rope
and
a
device
for
making
keys
In
a
bathroom
were
makeup
brushes
and
a
partly
empty
bottle
of
NyQuil
An
open
tube
of
golden
brunette
hair
dye
lay
on
the
sink
near
a
disposable
glove
stained
with
the
dye
s
residue
In
one
bedroom
were
three
more
gloves
yellow
crime-scene
tape
and
on
the
bed
a
spiked
dog-training
collar
in
another
was
a
bottle
of
Vaseline
lotion
used
paper
towels
and
a
penis
pump
This
is
creepy
Carausu
recalled
thinking
as
she
stuffed
items
into
paper
bags
Something
crazy
happened
in
here
The
police
also
collected
flashlights
cell
phones
hard
drives
and
several
computers
including
an
Asus
laptop
that
had
been
stashed
under
a
mattress
Around
noon
Carausu
and
her
colleagues
drove
to
a
tow
yard
to
search
a
stolen
white
Mustang
recovered
near
the
cabin
Inside
they
found
items
they
thought
could
be
linked
to
the
Dublin
break-in
two
gloves
matching
one
from
the
crime
scene
both
covered
in
foxtails
receipts
for
a
flashlight
a
speaker
and
zip
ties
purchased
near
Dublin
the
night
of
the
home
invasion
burglary
tools
and
a
metal
flashlight
The
back
seat
of
the
Mustang
had
been
removed
Carausu
wondered
if
someone
had
made
room
for
a
large
object
such
as
a
body
Strangely
other
clues
didn
t
seem
connected
to
the
Dublin
crime
Among
the
recent
destinations
on
the
car
s
GPS
was
an
address
in
Huntington
Beach
400
miles
south
of
Lake
Tahoe
In
the
trunk
Carausu
saw
a
blood-pressure
cuff
a
camouflage
tarp
and
a
mesh
vest
with
a
wireless
speaker
in
one
of
the
pockets
She
also
found
a
BB
gun
a
dart
gun
and
a
Nerf
Super
Soaker
that
had
been
painted
black
with
a
flashlight
and
a
laser
pointer
taped
to
the
barrel
Stuffed
in
a
large
duffel
bag
was
a
blow-up
doll
in
black
clothing
rigged
with
wiring
so
that
it
could
be
made
to
sit
or
stand
The
bag
also
contained
a
military-style
pistol
belt
its
pouches
crammed
with
two
pairs
of
Speedo
swim
goggles
Carausu
pulled
one
of
them
out
Black
duct
tape
covered
the
lenses
Caught
in
the
tape
was
a
long
strand
of
blond
hair
None
of
the
victims
in
the
Dublin
home
invasion
were
blond
Neither
was
the
suspect
which
Carausu
knew
because
she
d
watched
officers
escort
him
out
of
the
cabin
in
handcuffs
He
didn
t
put
up
a
fight
when
they
burst
through
the
door
He
wandered
out
of
a
bedroom
and
obeyed
commands
to
lie
on
the
ground
In
his
late
thirties
tall
and
fit
the
man
wore
a
black
athletic
shirt
and
jeans
He
resembled
Charlie
Sheen
with
a
chiseled
jawline
and
tousled
dark
hair
Do
you
know
why
we
re
here
a
detective
asked
Yes
he
replied
The
suspect
said
nothing
else
as
officers
led
him
to
a
patrol
car
Before
they
loaded
him
inside
Carausu
told
the
man
to
look
at
her
camera
He
stared
intensely
into
the
lens
his
mouth
an
indecipherable
line
Carausu
read
his
name
on
pill
bottles
and
mail
scattered
around
the
stolen
Mustang
Matthew
Muller
Muller
grew
up
in
the
suburbs
of
Sacramento
where
homes
flew
American
flags
wild
turkeys
roamed
the
streets
and
fathers
took
their
sons
fishing
for
bass
in
Lake
Natoma
His
mother
Joyce
was
a
middle
school
English
teacher
and
his
father
Monty
was
a
school
administrator
and
wrestling
coach
The
family
spent
summers
hiking
in
the
Sierra
Nevada
abalone
diving
in
Bodega
Bay
or
relaxing
at
a
lakeside
cabin
in
Michigan
Each
Christmas
they
hosted
a
party
on
their
cul
de
sac
and
Monty
dressed
up
as
Santa
Muller
was
a
strong-willed
introverted
child
Despite
his
father
s
best
efforts
he
didn
t
take
to
wrestling
or
football
preferring
to
run
or
ski
or
walk
the
dog
alone
He
played
trumpet
in
the
school
band
and
devoured
dystopian
novels
by
George
Orwell
Aldous
Huxley
and
Yevgeny
Zamyatin
His
favorite
short
story
Ray
Bradbury
s
The
Veldt
was
about
two
children
who
project
their
fantasies
onto
the
walls
of
a
virtual
reality
nursery
until
make-believe
lions
come
to
life
and
eat
the
siblings
parents
Muller
had
a
core
group
of
friends
at
school
but
bullies
teased
him
about
being
overweight
Being
picked
on
fueled
his
instinct
to
stick
up
for
underdogs
an
impulse
he
sometimes
took
to
extremes
When
his
younger
brother
Kent
was
slow
to
talk
he
appointed
himself
spokesperson
to
a
degree
that
concerned
their
mom
He
s
never
going
to
have
a
vocabulary
if
you
keep
speaking
for
him
Joyce
recalled
thinking
Later
Muller
stuffed
gum
in
a
girl
s
trumpet
after
she
taunted
someone
at
a
music
competition
During
his
senior
year
of
high
school
Muller
learned
that
his
father
was
having
an
affair
Monty
moved
in
with
the
woman
he
was
seeing
and
he
and
Joyce
divorced
Muller
soon
decided
to
enlist
in
the
Marines
telling
Joyce
that
he
needed
discipline
and
wanted
to
get
in
shape
In
truth
he
worried
that
paying
for
college
would
strain
her
finances
Muller
was
a
round
peg
struggling
to
fit
into
a
square
hole
in
the
Marines
his
roommate
during
boot
camp
later
wrote
In
the
first
13
weeks
he
lost
more
than
50
pounds
He
didn
t
join
his
platoon
mates
on
weekend
outings
instead
squeezing
in
extra
workouts
For
a
time
he
subsisted
on
Powerade
and
garlic
rice
He
earned
the
nickname
Sergeant
Mulder
after
the
FBI
agent
on
The
X-Files
because
of
his
deadpan
demeanor
Muller
bristled
at
recruits
who
preyed
on
perceived
weakness
When
some
bullied
his
roommate
Muller
stood
up
for
him
Muller
spent
three
years
playing
trumpet
in
the
Marine
Corps
band
at
bases
in
California
and
Japan
where
he
also
started
a
nonprofit
to
teach
locals
about
the
Internet
In
1999
he
deployed
to
train
soldiers
in
the
Middle
East
He
earned
several
medals
and
a
promotion
before
being
honorably
discharged
Back
home
in
California
Muller
attended
Pomona
College
where
he
threw
himself
into
volunteer
work
which
included
helping
homeless
people
secure
government
benefits
and
running
an
outdoors
program
More
than
anyone
I
had
ever
met
he
strived
to
be
noble
to
be
kind
to
be
generous
his
friend
Eve
Florin
later
wrote
In
the
summer
of
2001
Muller
traveled
to
Prague
for
an
academic
program
There
he
met
a
driven
young
woman
from
Kyrgyzstan
with
a
slight
figure
and
long
dark
hair
They
fell
in
love
The
woman
declined
to
be
interviewed
At
her
request
The
Atavist
is
not
using
her
name
After
Muller
graduated
from
Pomona
they
exchanged
vows
under
an
arch
of
white
roses
on
the
sun-dappled
shores
of
Donner
Lake
about
15
miles
north
of
Lake
Tahoe
In
2003
the
couple
moved
to
Boston
where
he
started
at
Harvard
Law
School
and
she
attended
Boston
College
Muller
became
involved
with
Harvard
s
Legal
Aid
Bureau
where
he
represented
low-income
tenants
and
immigrants
who
were
victims
of
domestic
violence
On
one
occasion
a
client
s
husband
found
a
business
card
that
the
bureau
s
receptionist
had
given
her
and
beat
her
so
severely
that
her
jaw
had
to
be
wired
shut
Muller
blamed
himself
Their
crisis
felt
like
it
was
part
of
my
life
too
he
said
in
an
interview
After
earning
his
law
degree
Muller
stayed
at
Harvard
to
teach
and
work
in
the
Immigration
and
Refugee
Clinical
Program
Dressing
in
suits
for
class
he
came
across
as
very
formal
intense
and
guarded
but
also
extremely
knowledgeable
and
someone
who
truly
cared
about
the
cause
and
the
immigrant
community
a
former
student
of
his
recalled
Muller
earned
near
perfect
ratings
as
a
lecturer
and
worked
with
Deborah
Anker
a
leading
scholar
of
immigration
law
authoring
papers
and
Supreme
Court
briefs
When
Anker
went
on
sabbatical
she
tapped
him
to
head
the
clinical
program
He
was
warm
caring
earnest
smart
enthusiastic
engaging
thoughtful
Anker
recalled
He
was
a
super
good
human
being
Muller
was
unusually
devoted
to
his
clients
buying
one
a
wedding
gift
and
letting
another
stay
at
his
apartment
Even
when
he
won
a
case
he
couldn
t
shake
the
injustice
he
perceived
in
the
world
Part
of
me
would
be
really
sad
because
it
should
not
take
all
this
effort
just
to
make
something
the
way
it
should
ve
been
he
said
He
likened
the
feeling
to
going
into
a
room
and
needing
to
straighten
the
picture
set
it
right
For
the
program
s
anniversary
one
year
Muller
tracked
down
dozens
of
alumni
and
framed
their
messages
as
a
gift
to
Anker
His
own
note
read
Learning
from
you
has
been
and
I
think
always
will
be
the
highlight
of
my
legal
career
This
struck
Anker
as
odd
I
thought
he
was
going
to
be
a
leading
immigration
lawyer
in
America
she
said
This
is
not
the
height
of
your
career—this
is
the
beginning
Muller
scoured
the
room
for
anything
out
of
place
anything
that
could
be
a
bug
Over
and
over
he
searched
for
answers
among
the
snaking
wires
and
blinking
lights
It
came
as
a
shock
to
Muller
s
parents
when
in
the
summer
of
2008
he
revealed
that
he
had
bipolar
disorder
Mental
illness
ran
in
Monty
s
family
though
they
didn
t
speak
of
it
much
Muller
had
never
mentioned
any
mental
health
problems
to
his
parents
beyond
sometimes
feeling
blue
during
the
winter
months
and
neither
had
his
wife
In
fact
Muller
had
grappled
with
disturbing
thoughts
since
his
time
in
the
Marines
After
receiving
a
series
of
anthrax
vaccines
before
his
Middle
East
mission
he
struggled
to
get
out
of
bed
for
weeks
and
his
performance
on
fitness
tests
plummeted
He
later
attributed
his
symptoms
to
Gulf
War
syndrome
For
the
first
time
bleak
thoughts
took
up
residence
in
his
mind
You
re
not
good
enough
you
re
the
worst
person
in
the
world
He
d
been
considering
a
long
career
in
the
military
but
now
he
decided
to
request
a
discharge
In
college
Muller
fell
into
a
cycle
Every
summer
and
fall
he
was
productive
and
slept
little
every
winter
and
spring
he
labored
to
finish
assignments
and
his
mood
darkened
As
the
winter
chill
set
in
during
his
second
year
of
law
school
negative
thoughts
cut
particularly
deep
You
re
not
doing
enough
to
help
you
re
horrible
the
world
is
terrible
For
the
first
time
he
contemplated
suicide
Over
the
years
Muller
saw
several
psychiatrists
One
at
Harvard
diagnosed
him
with
major
depression
noting
that
he
also
showed
signs
of
mania
Muller
tried
medication
but
stopped
each
time
because
he
didn
t
like
the
side
effects
He
took
pains
to
hide
his
condition
from
his
parents
from
his
colleagues
and
as
much
as
possible
from
his
wife
who
moved
away
in
2005
to
attend
law
school
It
felt
like
a
weakness
something
I
shouldn
t
be
troubling
other
people
with
Muller
said
He
especially
didn
t
want
anyone
finding
out
about
the
time
a
delusion
took
hold
of
him
It
happened
while
he
was
working
at
Harvard
in
an
office
on
the
fourth
floor
of
Pound
Hall
a
concrete
building
at
the
edge
of
campus
He
began
to
suspect
that
the
government
was
tapping
his
phone
and
hacking
his
computer
Officials
were
after
him
he
decided
because
some
of
his
clients
had
been
accused
of
having
links
to
terrorists
Nothing
specific
triggered
his
paranoia—it
began
as
a
feeling
and
his
mind
filled
in
the
gaps
Muller
frantically
inspected
wall
conduits
that
held
bundles
of
telephone
wires
and
followed
their
trail
to
a
server
room
in
the
basement
Through
a
crack
between
two
doors
he
glimpsed
a
mess
of
equipment
He
scoured
the
room
for
anything
out
of
place
anything
that
could
be
a
bug
Over
and
over
he
searched
for
answers
among
the
snaking
wires
and
blinking
lights
Muller
hoped
that
escaping
New
England
s
winters
and
trading
asylum
law
for
the
tamer
world
of
patent
litigation
would
improve
his
mood
so
in
2009
he
and
his
wife
moved
to
Silicon
Valley
where
he
started
a
job
at
a
large
law
firm
But
instead
of
feeling
better
he
again
became
suicidal
He
agreed
to
get
help
and
a
psychiatrist
prescribed
Wellbutrin
The
antidepressant
quieted
Muller
s
suicidal
thoughts
and
kept
him
productive
at
his
new
job
but
it
also
prevented
him
from
sleeping
One
night
he
was
tossing
and
turning
on
the
couch
to
avoid
waking
his
wife
when
he
heard
a
distant
muffled
voice
Half
asleep
he
thought
the
TV
had
come
on
He
heard
voices
again
on
subsequent
nights
closer
and
clearer
this
time
At
first
he
told
himself
he
was
dreaming
but
eventually
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
voices
were
there
when
he
was
awake
They
were
androgynous
almost
robotic
They
didn
t
tell
him
what
to
do
instead
they
kept
up
a
running
commentary
mostly
about
his
faults
Muller
didn
t
tell
his
family
concerned
they
d
think
he
was
dangerous
crazy
Nor
did
he
inform
his
psychiatrist
fearing
it
would
end
up
in
his
bar
application
He
had
let
his
new
employer
assume
that
he
wasn
t
yet
licensed
to
practice
law
because
he
needed
to
retake
the
bar
exam
in
fact
he
had
passed
the
exam
but
not
yet
registered
with
the
California
bar
agonizing
over
what
to
write
about
his
mental
health
in
the
required
moral
character
section
of
the
paperwork
In
Muller
s
telling
to
quiet
the
voices
and
wear
himself
out
enough
to
sleep
he
went
on
long
walks
at
night
Often
he
hiked
to
the
Stanford
Dish
a
radio
telescope
along
a
popular
trail
near
the
Stanford
University
campus
Not
long
after
midnight
one
Friday
in
late
September
2009
he
was
returning
to
his
car
in
College
Terrace
a
residential
neighborhood
in
Palo
Alto
when
a
police
officer
stopped
him
and
asked
to
see
his
ID
According
to
Muller
when
the
officer
inquired
what
he
was
doing
there
so
late
he
said
that
he
was
visiting
a
friend—he
was
reluctant
to
admit
that
he
d
trespassed
on
a
trail
that
was
closed
after
dark
The
officer
reported
that
Muller
claimed
to
be
a
visiting
professor
at
Stanford
which
police
later
determined
was
false
Three
weeks
later
a
Palo
Alto
police
detective
came
to
Muller
s
apartment
and
left
a
business
card
with
his
wife
When
Muller
called
the
number
he
learned
that
police
wanted
to
question
him
about
an
attempted
sexual
assault
in
College
Terrace
His
name
had
come
up
in
recent
reports
of
suspicious
persons
in
the
area
He
told
the
detective
that
he
d
read
about
the
incident
in
the
local
paper
and
he
agreed
to
meet
According
to
Muller
before
he
could
make
it
to
the
station
two
detectives
showed
up
at
his
law
firm
to
question
him
The
encounter
set
him
on
edge
He
wondered
if
the
detectives
had
come
to
install
spy
equipment
in
his
office
Recalling
his
recent
asylum
cases
he
decided
that
they
were
conspiring
with
the
Chinese
government
The
Palo
Alto
Police
Department
declined
to
confirm
that
Muller
was
questioned
at
his
office
citing
an
open
investigation
Muller
already
had
suspicions
about
a
certain
Honda
Accord
often
parked
near
his
apartment
He
d
been
placing
pebbles
behind
the
wheels
to
check
whether
it
moved
and
varying
his
route
to
work
to
avoid
being
followed
Now
he
memorized
exit
routes
in
his
office
building
and
worked
with
the
blinds
shut
When
he
became
convinced
that
his
pursuers
were
using
a
laser
microphone
to
pick
up
sound
vibrations
in
his
office
he
decamped
to
the
firm
s
library
It
seemed
like
this
was
going
to
rapidly
escalate
They
were
trying
to
destroy
me
because
they
wanted
to
make
me
lose
my
job
isolate
me
make
me
lose
my
credibility
Muller
recalled
thinking
At
that
point
I
started
getting
afraid
for
my
family
He
felt
he
had
no
choice
but
to
flee
Muller
traded
his
car
which
he
assumed
was
bugged
for
his
mother
s
SUV
and
stocked
up
on
food
and
survival
gear
A
few
days
later
he
disappeared
The
day
after
the
South
Lake
Tahoe
raid
Misty
Carausu
arrived
at
her
new
office
on
the
second
floor
of
the
Dublin
Civic
Center
At
the
time
the
police
department
occupied
half
the
building
which
resembles
a
ring
cut
in
half
and
the
fragments
slid
apart
Carausu
sat
down
in
an
empty
gray
cubicle
in
a
room
with
drab
carpeting
She
hadn
t
yet
tacked
up
photos
of
her
teenage
son
whom
she
had
at
16
and
raised
on
her
own
Carausu
didn
t
plan
on
becoming
a
cop
Pretty
and
bubbly
with
manicured
nails
and
striking
hazel
eyes
she
was
in
her
mid-twenties
and
working
as
an
assistant
manager
at
a
Safeway
when
a
friend
s
husband
was
convicted
of
sexually
assaulting
a
mutual
friend
She
joined
the
force
hoping
to
find
justice
for
rape
victims
After
a
decade
as
a
deputy
Carausu
who
fostered
bunnies
sometimes
compared
herself
to
Judy
Hopps
the
idealistic
rabbit
who
works
as
a
cop
in
Disney
s
Zootopia
As
she
labeled
evidence
from
the
cabin
Carausu
couldn
t
get
the
blond
strand
of
hair
she
d
found
in
the
Mustang
out
of
her
mind
This
wasn
t
his
first
time
she
told
her
colleagues
We
re
going
to
solve
some
crimes
With
her
boss
s
support
Carausu
began
to
investigate
whether
they
d
stumbled
onto
something
larger
than
a
single
home
invasion
In
police
databases
Matthew
Muller
s
name
yielded
a
hit
for
an
unsolved
2009
break-in
near
Stanford
A
32-year-old
woman
was
sleeping
in
her
apartment
in
College
Terrace
when
a
strange
man
jumped
on
top
of
her
He
appeared
to
be
in
his
twenties
and
was
white
tall
and
lean
He
wore
a
mask
black
gloves
and
black
spandex-like
clothing
The
man
tied
her
hands
behind
her
back
bound
her
ankles
with
Velcro
straps
and
covered
her
eyes
with
tape
Then
he
gave
her
a
choice
drink
NyQuil
get
shocked
with
a
stun
gun
or
be
injected
with
what
he
called
A-bomb
When
she
opted
for
the
NyQuil
the
man
confirmed
with
her
that
she
wasn
t
allergic
to
any
of
its
ingredients
before
pouring
the
medicine
down
her
throat
The
intruder
gathered
personal
information
and
indicated
he
d
use
it
to
steal
her
money
At
times
the
victim
heard
the
man
whisper
to
someone
and
she
would
later
describe
seeing
a
silhouette
in
the
room
but
she
never
heard
a
second
voice
She
reported
that
the
man
tried
to
rape
her
and
she
fought
back
When
she
made
up
a
story
about
having
been
raped
in
high
school
he
stopped
saying
he
didn
t
want
to
victimize
her
again
Before
leaving
he
threatened
to
harm
her
family
if
she
called
911
and
mentioned
that
he
had
planted
evidence
to
mislead
authorities
Three
weeks
before
the
attack
Carausu
learned
a
police
officer
had
come
across
Muller
walking
late
at
night
in
the
vicinity
of
the
crime
Police
later
discovered
that
the
College
Terrace
victim
a
Stanford
student
had
attended
an
event
that
Muller
organized
at
Harvard
the
previous
year
Palo
Alto
detectives
identified
him
as
their
primary
suspect
But
DNA
recovered
at
the
crime
scene
wasn
t
a
match
Ultimately
law
enforcement
didn
t
find
enough
evidence
to
recommend
charging
Muller
Carausu
discovered
that
the
home
invasion
had
eerie
parallels
to
two
other
unsolved
crimes
in
Silicon
Valley
Less
than
a
month
before
the
College
Terrace
incident
a
27-year-old
woman
in
Mountain
View
woke
around
5
a.
m
to
find
a
man
on
top
of
her
He
appeared
to
be
white
and
slim
about
six
feet
tall
and
wore
tight
black
clothing
and
a
ski
mask
When
she
started
screaming
he
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
and
explained
that
he
was
part
of
a
group
of
criminals
that
planned
to
steal
her
identity
and
wire
money
abroad
The
man
bound
her
hands
and
ankles
then
placed
blacked-out
swim
goggles
over
her
eyes—she
felt
her
hair
catch
in
one
of
the
straps
He
made
her
drink
what
tasted
like
cough
syrup
before
collecting
personal
information
At
one
point
he
used
her
phone
to
send
a
message
to
her
boss
saying
that
she
was
sick
Periodically
the
woman
heard
him
talking
to
someone
but
she
never
heard
or
saw
anyone
else
Eventually
the
man
told
her
I
have
some
bad
news
I
m
going
to
have
to
rape
you
According
to
an
account
the
victim
later
shared
with
NBC
s
Dateline
she
begged
him
not
to
and
he
relented
I
can
t
do
this
he
muttered
I
m
sorry
about
this
Throughout
the
encounter
the
intruder
was
polite
the
victim
recalled
Before
leaving
he
advised
her
to
get
a
dog
for
protection
The
woman
told
Dateline
that
when
she
called
the
Mountain
View
police
they
initially
suggested
she
might
have
had
a
bad
dream
Ultimately
authorities
concluded
that
the
person
behind
the
attack
had
also
likely
committed
the
one
in
College
Terrace
In
a
statement
for
this
story
the
Mountain
View
police
said
We
continue
to
keep
this
investigation
open
and
have
been
and
are
treating
it
seriously
The
final
case
Carausu
learned
about
happened
three
years
after
the
other
two
in
November
2012
A
26-year-old
woman
who
lived
just
north
of
the
Stanford
campus
awoke
at
2:20
a.
m
to
see
a
masked
man
in
gloves
and
dark
clothing
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
He
held
her
down
but
she
screamed
and
fought
back
Eventually
he
fled
The
woman
later
noticed
that
her
computer
had
been
moved
and
found
two
bump
keys
which
open
any
lock
from
a
certain
manufacturer
near
the
front
door
In
neither
that
case
nor
the
one
in
Mountain
View
was
Muller
named
as
a
suspect
Carausu
stumbled
upon
an
additional
clue
when
she
called
the
owner
of
the
stolen
Mustang
police
had
recovered
in
South
Lake
Tahoe
He
turned
out
to
be
a
medical
student
who
lived
on
the
edge
of
Mare
Island
40
miles
northwest
of
Dublin
In
early
January
2015
he
had
returned
from
a
trip
to
find
that
someone
had
taken
his
car
keys
from
his
home
and
driven
his
Mustang
out
of
the
garage
When
Carausu
told
him
that
her
department
had
arrested
someone
for
a
home
invasion
near
where
his
car
was
found
he
asked
if
she
d
heard
of
the
Mare
Island
creeper
a
Peeping
Tom
Between
August
2014
and
January
2015
at
least
four
women
in
the
area
had
reported
seeing
a
man
peering
through
their
windows
or
climbing
on
their
roof
Two
had
just
taken
a
shower
when
they
spotted
him
One
saw
him
taking
pictures
while
another
saw
him
descending
a
ladder
Two
of
the
women
lived
on
the
same
street
Kirkland
Avenue
Some
of
the
women
described
the
voyeur
as
a
white
man
25
to
35
wearing
a
black
jacket
In
August
2014
according
to
a
Facebook
post
later
documented
in
a
police
report
a
Mare
Island
resident
who
heard
sounds
on
his
roof
late
one
night
saw
someone
fitting
a
similar
description
flee
with
a
ladder
The
resident
encountered
a
strange
man
on
two
other
occasions
One
night
the
man
was
crouching
under
the
resident
s
window
he
said
he
was
searching
for
his
puppy
a
husky
Another
night
the
resident
found
the
same
man
in
his
backyard
where
he
claimed
to
be
looking
for
531
Kirkland
Ave.
the
address
didn
t
exist
The
student
spotted
the
man
a
third
time
walking
a
young
husky
and
a
golden
retriever
According
to
a
Facebook
post
a
woman
who
lived
on
Klein
Avenue
a
block
from
Kirkland
said
that
her
neighbor
had
a
husky
and
a
golden
retriever
The
owner
of
the
Mustang
told
Carausu
that
he
d
heard
the
woman
s
neighbor
was
a
former
lawyer
who
had
been
in
the
military
Then
as
suddenly
as
the
Peeping
Tom
incidents
started
they
stopped
It
was
about
the
same
time
that
the
Vallejo
kidnapping
happened
the
Mustang
owner
told
Carausu
Why
does
that
ring
a
bell
she
thought
After
the
Dublin
home
invasion
and
Muller
s
arrest
a
colleague
of
Carausu
s
had
put
out
an
alert
asking
area
police
departments
for
information
about
similar
crimes
Vallejo
didn
t
respond
Online
Carausu
found
news
stories
about
the
kidnapping
which
occurred
three
months
earlier
She
noted
that
one
of
the
victims
had
blond
hair
Then
she
remembered
why
the
case
had
caught
her
attention
The
Vallejo
police
had
deemed
it
a
hoax

For
Matt
McAuliffe
I
Sometime
during
what
I
hoped
would
be
the
end
of
the
pandemic
I
found
myself
hungover
and
alone
in
my
front
yard
sweating
as
I
stared
at
the
piles
of
crap
I
had
to
cram
into
our
Subaru
piles
that
would
somehow
cohere
into
our
temporary
new
life
Fuck
me
I
said
And
fuck
this
My
family
and
I
were
leaving
for
the
summer
but
not
by
choice
I
work
at
a
boarding
school
Which
is
a
win
mostly
free
house
no
commute
but
sometimes
not
Like
when
a
virus
wreaks
havoc
on
a
global
scale
and
we
re
forced
to
vacate
so
the
school
can
fast-track
renovations
while
the
students
are
gone
I
hear
the
Torreys
are
moving
a
colleague
said
a
little
too
cheerfully
when
he
saw
me
on
my
walk
In
those
early
COVID
days
as
my
wife
and
I
struggled
to
work
without
childcare
I
burned
hours
marching
in
circles
with
my
kids
in
the
stroller
Not
exactly
I
said
through
my
mask
The
man
s
eyebrows
arched
They
re
installing
central
air
I
explained
So
we
re
moving
now
then
coming
home
in
August
to
move
back
in
Well
he
shrugged
at
least
you
ll
have
A/C
But
we
also
have
to
move
Twice
In
three
months
With
two
kids
All
while
the
world
is
falling
apart
Strange
times
he
said
But
you
ll
survive
But
complain
though
I
did
about
the
move
I
knew
deep
down
I
needed
a
change
Late
in
2019
my
wife
and
I
had
become
parents
for
the
second
time
and
after
a
long
paternity
leave
during
which
I
celebrated
my
younger
son
being
much
easier
than
his
brother
by
blasting
Marlboro
Reds
and
pounding
cheap
pinot
noir
I
decided
to
see
if
I
could
stop
drinking
Shockingly
I
could
All
through
January
as
the
booze
worked
its
way
from
my
system
I
felt
reborn
I
lost
weight
My
skin
glowed
People
kept
saying
there
was
light
in
my
eyes
By
February
I
marveled
at
why
I
d
blown
years
getting
wasted
in
the
first
place
Why
had
I
been
so
keen
to
embarrass
myself
to
black
out
and
barely
remember
the
nights
I
d
been
dying
to
enjoy
And
what
was
this
feeling
I
was
feeling
Then
I
realized
it
was
joy
or
at
least
the
absence
of
shame
When
you
re
not
constantly
hungover
it
turns
out
the
world
s
a
kinder
place
I
like
this
my
wife
told
me
as
we
sat
up
chatting
in
bed
Yeah
I
said
me
too
And
so
began
the
thinking
of
big
thoughts
While
I
bathed
my
sons
or
stayed
up
late
reading
I
swallowed
a
sad
truth
I
d
known
for
a
very
long
time
I
was
an
alcoholic
While
my
friends
all
had
bad
nights
for
me
it
was
different
I
was
always
drinking
almost
normally
then
abnormally
then
insanely
and
then
after
making
a
supreme
ass
of
myself
I
d
rein
it
in
only
to
begin
the
cycle
again
The
idea
of
saying
goodbye
was
scary
but
I
already
had
two
months
under
my
belt
All
I
had
to
do
was
keep
going
Kickstart
your
weekend
reading
by
getting
the
week
s
best
Longreads
delivered
to
your
inbox
every
Friday
afternoon
Sign
up
But
then
I
turned
35
and
got
smashed
drunk
The
night
was
unremarkable
My
wife
and
I
sipped
drinks
while
watching
the
BBC
s
Normal
People
She
quit
after
a
few
glasses
of
rosé
but
I
plowed
through
Negronis
until
I
passed
out
In
the
days
after
as
the
liquor
re-adhered
to
my
psyche
and
I
struggled
to
reckon
with
my
choice
to
get
fucked
up
the
news
all
at
once
became
all
about
COVID
One
day
Trump
banned
travel
from
Europe
On
another
New
York
friends
called
to
talk
through
plans
of
escape
Soon
after
we
were
all
in
the
middle
of
a
Global
Pandemic
Somewhere
in
all
this
I
found
myself
at
Costco
with
a
T-shirt
on
my
face
My
wife
had
sent
me
in
search
of
diapers
and
wipes
and
hopefully
a
gigantic
pallet
of
toilet
paper
but
there
I
was
as
if
by
magic
alone
in
the
liquor
department
filling
my
huge
shopping
cart
with
alcohol
and
not
just
the
normal
haul
of
tallboys
and
budget
wine
multiple
handles
of
whiskey
and
gin
What
the
fuck
am
I
doing
I
thought
as
a
sad-looking
lady
rang
me
up
But
then
of
course
I
knew
I
was
leaning
into
the
worst
of
my
instincts
telling
myself
without
telling
myself
that
if
the
world
didn
t
have
to
play
by
the
rules
neither
did
I
My
days
collapsed
into
a
parade
of
hangovers
so
bad
I
wanted
to
die
Each
morning
after
waking
in
agony
and
bearing
a
barrage
of
anger
from
my
wife
I
did
what
I
could
to
make
breakfast
for
my
kids
and
not
suffer
a
total
meltdown
as
they
turned
our
kitchen
into
a
shithouse
of
cereal
and
yogurt
And
then
somehow
unshowered
and
in
the
middle
of
a
five-alarm
headache
I
d
barricade
myself
in
my
bedroom
often
with
a
baby
on
my
lap
skim
poems
by
Marie
Howe
and
Adrienne
Rich
and
do
what
I
could
to
inspire
my
students
to
be
anything
more
than
what
the
pandemic
had
rendered
them
depressed
and
shell-shocked
little
thumbnails
too
naive
to
see
how
booze-whipped
I
was
and
too
good-natured
to
do
anything
as
reasonable
as
bitch
but
kids
who
d
nonetheless
devolved
from
pupils
I
adored
into
another
obstacle
between
waking
and
drinking
How
was
class
my
wife
asked
I
gave
her
a
dead-eyed
stare
as
I
put
the
boys
in
the
stroller
thinking
all
the
while
Must
Stop
Destroying
Self
When
night
fell
and
my
kids
were
asleep
I
d
practically
vibrate
at
the
notion
of
getting
drunk
I
knew
how
to
mix
a
drink
of
course
but
I
also
knew
I
d
need
six
drinks
to
feel
or
not
feel
the
way
I
wanted
to
I
also
knew
that
my
wife
s
patience
would
never
abide
that
many
But
two
that
could
be
done
So
I
made
my
first
as
strong
as
three
Most
often
I
drank
in
a
plastic
chair
in
my
front
yard
As
another
day
faded
I
marveled
at
life
s
strangeness
In
the
span
of
a
month
I
d
burned
down
my
nascent
sobriety
and
watched
the
pendulum
swing
so
hard
that
as
a
35-year-old
father
of
two
I
was
drinking
more
than
I
had
as
a
college
frat
boy
My
community
had
vanished
either
strictly
sequestered
or
gone
entirely
and
campus
felt
like
purgatory
Sometimes
I
d
FaceTime
friends
making
light
of
how
drunk
I
was
the
fucked-up
state
of
the
world
But
mostly
I
gazed
at
the
branches
of
a
chestnut
tree
watching
as
another
evening
fell
to
black
my
brain
all
the
while
making
sad
calculations
How
long
would
the
pandemic
last
Would
I
lose
my
job
Myself
Could
all
this
drinking
destroy
my
marriage
And
you
could
just
stop
I
thought
Be
a
good
husband
and
dad
and
teacher
and
resume
your
personhood
That
option
remained
But
so
did
the
other
one
the
one
where
I
kept
pushing
the
one
where
I
pretended
this
wouldn
t
only
get
worse
Besides
my
drink
was
empty
If
I
got
up
to
make
another
quickly
enough
my
wife
would
never
know
about
the
first
one
By
Easter
I
was
coming
apart
After
trying
in
vain
to
dye
brown
eggs
and
watching
my
older
son
lose
it
when
he
learned
he
couldn
t
eat
all
the
candy
in
his
basket
in
one
sitting
I
put
on
my
Mizunos
blasted
Fiona
Apple
That
s
where
the
pain
comes
in/like
a
second
skeleton
and
made
for
the
school
s
trails
Summer
was
coming
and
as
I
jogged
past
groves
of
walnut
trees
I
made
myself
believe
I
d
be
OK
Once
we
escaped
to
Habersham
South
Carolina
the
posh
community
where
my
wife
s
parents
and
aunts
and
uncles
had
all
retired
and
our
COVID
destination
our
problems
would
be
solved
I
d
be
born
again
in
the
Southern
heat
not
sober
but
sober-adjacent
My
in-laws
would
help
with
the
kids
I
d
get
some
writing
done
we
d
spend
afternoons
by
the
pool
and
the
evenings
would
be
a
pleasant
carousel
of
single
malt
scotch
and
peel-and-eat
shrimp
While
my
friends
all
had
bad
nights
for
me
it
was
different
I
was
always
drinking
almost
normally
then
abnormally
then
insanely
and
then
after
making
a
supreme
ass
of
myself
I
d
rein
it
in
only
to
begin
the
cycle
again
Rounding
a
bend
in
the
trails
I
made
out
a
lone
figure
the
school
s
French
teacher
who
I
hadn
t
seen
in
months
As
I
called
her
name
she
turned
and
shrank
Oh
Will
she
said
you
scared
me
She
d
just
come
back
from
New
York
where
friends
and
family
had
contracted
COVID
A
few
had
even
been
put
on
ventilators
Jesus
I
said
Yeah
They
might
like
actually
die
When
she
asked
about
my
family
I
wasted
no
time
in
lashing
out
at
the
school
for
making
us
move
at
Trump
for
mishandling
the
plague
at
the
drudgery
of
teaching
on
Zoom
As
I
got
more
and
more
riled
I
could
see
in
her
eyes
a
glimmer
of
alarm
Earlier
in
the
fall
my
wife
and
I
had
hosted
her
for
duck
à
l
orange
and
too
much
wine
and
we
stayed
up
past
midnight
trading
stories
and
cracking
up
Now
I
was
a
bloated
derelict
shouting
into
the
wind
And
my
drinking
I
said
Every
day
I
tell
myself
to
stop
But
I
can
t
I
sit
alone
and
drink
myself
into
oblivion
Oh
she
said
Sorry
I
said
I
just
–
No
no
It
s
okay
I
just
think
you
ve
got
ta
get
rid
of
the
alcohol
Just
get
all
the
bottles
and
pour
them
down
the
drain
Right
I
said
Back
home
I
told
my
wife
in
my
most
solemn
tone
I
was
done
drinking
For
how
long
Forever
or
at
least
until
the
world
goes
back
to
normal
That
night
as
we
set
the
table
for
lamb
chops
I
walked
into
the
kitchen
and
uncorked
a
bottle
of
red
And
this
was
just
the
way
life
was
For
a
hundred
days
as
a
murderous
virus
floated
through
the
air
I
drank
myself
into
a
hole
But
the
time
to
move
finally
arrived
The
Subaru
was
packed
All
that
lay
between
now
and
a
better
life
was
700
miles
of
I-95
As
I
locked
the
car
another
colleague
passed
this
time
the
school
s
biology
teacher
South
Carolina
tomorrow
she
asked
Come
hell
or
COVID-19
She
smiled
and
turned
but
stopped
Say
did
you
hear
about
that
woman
down
in
Kiawah
No
What
happened
The
biology
teacher
shook
her
head
Eaten
by
a
gator
II
The
heat
After
11
hours
barreling
down
the
interstate
past
Capitol
Harbor
past
South
of
the
Border
past
two
enormous
Confederate
flags
and
stopping
just
once
to
piss
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
Walmart
in
Bumfuck
North
Carolina
driving
on
and
on
with
two
kids
drunk
on
Benadryl
and
Sour
Skittles
the
noise
of
Raffi
blaring
all
the
while
after
all
that
what
I
remember
is
the
heat
All-enveloping
Time-stopping
Like
a
blanket
of
ennui
We
re
here
I
thought
and
as
soon
as
I
got
out
crunching
the
gravel
behind
our
townhouse
I
felt
the
sharp
sense
that
nothing
would
change
On
our
first
morning
after
a
night
alone
drinking
rum
in
the
bathtub
I
loaded
the
boys
and
set
out
on
an
hours-long
march
My
older
son
marveled
at
the
new
terrain
oak
trees
draped
in
Spanish
moss
camelia
and
foxtail
ferns
the
ground
alive
with
lizards
and
crabs
Somewhere
along
the
way
a
fat
old
man
buzzed
up
in
a
golf
cart
Y
all
be
careful
now
he
said
nodding
to
one
of
the
man-made
ponds
Momma
gator
up
the
way
Extra
territorial
What
did
he
say
my
son
asked
Nothing
Everything
s
fine
We
strolled
past
the
pool
and
along
the
marsh
We
listened
to
egrets
and
professional
power
washers
readying
rich
people
s
homes
for
the
summer
stopping
now
and
then
simply
to
marvel
at
this
place
our
swampy
little
hideaway
in
the
Low
Country
half
a
nation
away
from
the
cold
desolation
that
had
been
our
lot
Where
was
COVID
here
I
wondered
Even
the
notion
of
it
seemed
like
a
myth
People
down
here
didn
t
even
wear
masks
On
our
way
back
to
the
townhouse
we
crossed
a
footbridge
I
waved
to
two
teens
fishing
and
their
eyes
went
wide
Before
I
could
think
my
head
swiveled
to
a
patch
of
grass
where
an
enormous
alligator
basked
and
stared
at
my
children
How
long
would
it
take
I
wondered
for
this
beast
to
steal
my
kids
Ten
seconds
Five
Careful
one
boy
said
Yeah
I
told
him
thanks
Habersham
was
to
be
a
happy
place
It
was
not
My
wife
and
I
were
on
the
edge
of
a
meltdown
and
the
change
in
scenery
we
d
hoped
would
fix
us
had
only
made
things
worse
Within
days
after
we
d
worked
to
turn
the
half-furnished
home
of
a
family
friend
into
our
short-term
crash
pad
I
began
to
realize
that
just
as
I
d
fashioned
a
secret
fantasy
for
the
summer
one
wherein
I
kept
drinking
without
consequences
so
too
had
my
wife
Only
her
secret
fantasy
had
been
me
getting
my
shit
together
Everything
would
ve
been
better
had
we
made
time
to
talk
but
instead
we
lashed
out
My
wife
screamed
at
me
for
half-assing
the
assembly
of
our
new
bed
I
shouted
at
her
for
always
being
on
edge
My
wife
screamed
at
me
for
making
too
many
big
drinks
I
shouted
at
her
for
always
picking
fights
At
the
end
of
our
first
week
after
putting
the
kids
to
bed
she
found
me
slouched
at
the
granite
island
drinking
a
Double
Manhattan
You
fucking
drunk
she
screamed
eyes
bright
Just
sitting
here
getting
smashed
I
thought
of
the
neighbors
an
old
couple
who
unsure
of
COVID
etiquette
had
welcomed
me
to
the
block
with
a
fist
bump
If
she
shouted
any
louder
they
might
call
the
cops
The
only
time
we
have
to
breathe
she
went
on
the
only
time
we
have
to
think
and
you
re
just
down
here
knocking
yourself
out
I
d
like
to
say
I
poured
out
my
drink
I
d
like
to
say
I
said
sorry
But
what
I
did
instead
was
scream
back
Instead
we
yelled
until
our
faces
burned
and
then
sat
in
silence
at
a
bistro
table
on
the
porch
pushing
pesto
salmon
and
orzo
around
in
utter
silence
What
happened
was
my
wife
went
to
bed
early
and
I
stayed
up
getting
drunk
With
the
help
of
my
wife
s
parents
we
resumed
our
lives
In
the
mornings
my
in-laws
braved
the
heat
and
took
the
boys
on
walks
so
I
could
write
and
my
wife
could
work
In
the
afternoons
during
naptime
I
went
for
runs
and
ran
errands
while
my
wife
sat
on
Zoom
In
the
hours
before
bed
we
loaded
the
stroller
with
floaties
and
beers
and
walked
to
the
pool
where
rich
retirees
basked
in
the
sun
My
in-laws
came
over
for
dinner
and
most
nights
I
held
myself
together
at
least
while
they
were
there
One
night
alone
and
drunk
my
phone
lit
with
news
that
a
woman
in
Minneapolis
had
filmed
a
cop
killing
a
Black
man
I
told
myself
not
to
watch
but
in
the
stillness
of
the
screened-in
porch
I
felt
paralyzed
to
do
much
else
I
clicked
the
link
and
sipped
warm
gin
the
liquor
humming
through
me
as
I
watched
this
man
s
whole
being
slacken
from
anger
to
fear
to
resignation
and
then
death
I
set
down
my
phone
and
stared
at
the
fan
Slowly
spinning
and
spinning
I
watched
the
reel
again
Days
later
as
we
strolled
to
the
pool
my
wife
s
brother
called
to
say
our
sister-in-law
was
in
labor
with
our
second
niece
As
I
lounged
in
the
cold
water
greased
in
sunscreen
and
sipping
IPAs
I
couldn
t
stop
seeing
them
in
that
delivery
room
my
sister-in-law
doing
what
people
had
done
for
all
eternity
pushing
a
living
person
out
into
an
uncertain
world
Only
now
the
world
was
less
certain
than
ever
When
would
I
get
to
meet
this
baby
Would
she
be
healthy
Would
COVID
ruin
her
entire
childhood
For
a
hundred
days
as
a
murderous
virus
floated
through
the
air
I
drank
myself
into
a
hole
But
the
time
to
move
finally
arrived
The
Subaru
was
packed
All
that
lay
between
now
and
a
better
life
was
700
miles
of
I-95
That
evening
we
sat
on
my
in-laws
porch
sipping
French
chardonnay
and
doing
our
best
to
answer
these
questions
doing
our
best
I
think
not
to
feel
lucky
that
our
own
kids
had
been
born
before
this
started
As
the
sun
fell
into
the
trees
by
the
marsh
we
said
good
night
and
made
for
the
stroller
But
just
as
we
turned
we
heard
a
strange
noise
a
dull
thud
a
crashing
I
cut
my
eyes
in
time
to
see
what
I
was
sure
was
a
rolled-up
rug
landing
after
a
toss
down
a
porch
staircase
Is
that
a
person
my
mother-in-law
asked
No
I
said
but
then
I
saw
that
it
was
an
old
lady
moaning
on
the
ground
*Some
names
have
been
changed
to
protect
privacy
As
my
mother-in-law
and
I
ran
over
I
remembered
who
she
was
Elaine
*
a
reclusive
drinker
who
apart
from
lashing
out
at
members
of
Habersham
s
yard
crew
or
leaving
terse
notes
on
illegally
parked
cars
as
she
d
once
done
to
mine
was
essentially
a
hermit
Just
a
lonesome
old
woman
waiting
things
out
She
was
an
injured
animal
when
we
got
to
her
a
little
ball
of
pain
in
the
grass
It
was
90
degrees
out
yet
she
wore
slippers
sweatpants
and
a
thick
cotton
top
She
reached
for
my
arm
I
was
just
putting
out
repellent
Repellent
For
the
deer
We
better
call
an
ambulance
my
mother-in-law
said
No
no
Just
get
me
back
inside
The
light
caught
her
face
then
and
when
my
gaze
met
hers
I
watched
a
hematoma
over
her
eyebrow
balloon
from
a
marble
to
a
golf
ball
You
re
hurt
I
said
Maybe
badly
I
was
just
putting
out
the
repellent
My
mother-in-law
looked
at
her
neighbor
Elaine
would
it
be
all
right
if
Will
carried
you
in
I
hoisted
Elaine
s
hundred
pounds
over
my
shoulder
and
climbed
the
stairs
down
which
she
d
just
tumbled
the
stairs
that
had
she
fallen
differently
might
ve
killed
her
Elaine
s
clothes
were
stained
and
filthy
Her
toenails
gnarled
and
black
When
I
got
her
back
in
I
understood
the
warm
clothes
The
thermostat
was
so
low
that
the
sweat
on
my
body
became
a
sheet
of
ice
and
as
I
laid
her
on
the
couch
I
shivered
While
my
mother-in-law
sussed
out
whether
it
was
safe
to
leave
Elaine
I
took
in
the
room
White
sofa
and
loveseat
high-end
and
pristine
A
beautiful
glass
table
spread
thick
with
Southern
Living
and
House
Beautiful
And
there
at
center
stage
before
the
couch
that
served
as
the
setting
for
most
of
her
life
was
a
huge
plastic
cup
brimming
with
white
wine
Do
you
know
what
day
it
is
I
asked
She
did
Do
you
know
who
the
president
is
She
did
The
hematoma
grew
bigger
Elaine
thanked
me
again
and
again
but
I
knew
deep
down
she
was
mortified
She
just
wanted
us
to
leave
so
she
could
get
back
to
drinking
to
black
out
and
forget
all
this
happened
You
call
me
my
mother-in-law
told
her
If
your
head
starts
hurting
we
ll
get
you
to
the
hospital
As
we
marched
home
my
mother-in-law
was
silent
I
just
can
t
believe
it
I
said
I
mean
to
give
your
life
over
to
booze
like
that
It
…
it
s
A
shame
Yes
I
said
Then
I
went
home
and
got
drunk
We
trudged
through
the
days
In
the
mornings
I
wrote
stories
about
alcoholic
teachers
and
went
for
long
runs
I
read
novels
by
Philip
Roth
and
James
Salter
and
Michael
Chabon
In
the
evenings
we
watched
the
boys
swim
and
shot
the
shit
with
other
young
couples
all
of
whom
upon
hearing
the
events
that
lead
us
from
a
shut-down
boarding
school
to
Habersham
never
failed
to
say
how
lucky
we
were
And
it
was
true
While
Americans
shuttered
restaurants
and
struggled
to
file
for
unemployment
we
lived
in
a
half-million
dollar
townhouse
and
took
meandering
strolls
to
the
luxury
pool
While
the
death
count
ticked
up
and
up
we
barely
thought
of
COVID
and
when
we
did
it
was
in
the
abstract
some
faraway
tragedy
like
a
famine
in
the
Sahara
something
that
was
sad
but
didn
t
have
much
to
do
with
us
Nonetheless
we
felt
trapped
and
exhausted
Nonetheless
every
night
was
the
same
Whether
I
drank
rye
or
gin
or
red
or
white
I
drank
too
much
I
drank
to
the
point
that
I
had
to
be
careful
getting
up
from
my
chair
to
the
point
where
watching
a
movie
was
pointless
because
I
d
never
remember
it
Every
morning
I
woke
to
the
sting
of
another
body-shaking
hangover
and
every
morning
I
d
tell
myself
enough
But
every
evening
as
I
popped
the
cork
on
another
bottle
of
Campuget
I
smiled
and
thought
this
time
it
ll
be
different
One
morning
my
older
son
startled
me
as
I
vacuumed
In
his
hands
he
held
an
old
stethoscope
left
behind
by
the
previous
tenant
I
set
down
the
Dyson
and
knelt
beside
him
What
do
you
have
bubba
Teth-a-scope
He
stuck
in
the
earpieces
and
put
the
bell
to
his
chest
Do
you
hear
it
I
asked
Boom-boom
boom-boom
He
moved
the
bell
to
my
chest
and
looked
right
at
me
That
s
you
daddy
That
s
your
heart
Another
night
drunk
and
alone
on
the
screened-in
porch
My
phone
blinked
with
a
flurry
of
texts
Old
friends
all
weighing
in
on
another
police
killing
This
time
the
Black
man
was
Rayshard
Brooks
Why
did
he
run
What
was
he
thinking
He
shouldn
t
have
been
driving
in
the
first
place
They
should
ve
shot
him
in
the
leg
I
tossed
my
phone
and
swigged
warm
gin
feeling
flaccid
and
angry
My
phone
lit
again
this
time
with
friends
from
the
first
chain
making
a
new
chain
to
talk
shit
They
re
so
narrow-minded
And
offensive
And
racist
Do
you
think
they
ve
even
seen
the
video
I
realized
then
I
hadn
t
seen
it
myself
I
finished
my
gin
and
loaded
the
reel
And
as
I
drunkenly
watched
an
over-the-line
guy
getting
arrested
for
passing
out
in
a
Wendy
s
drive-thru
and
then
trying
drunkenly
to
run
only
to
be
shot
to
death
I
felt
completely
unstuck
from
reality
While
a
virus
that
virtually
no
one
in
South
Carolina
could
be
bothered
to
take
seriously
was
straining
our
nation
s
hospitals
while
the
notion
of
ever
going
back
to
normal
remained
totally
unclear
I
was
drunk
on
a
porch
watching
another
Black
guy
get
murdered
She
was
an
injured
animal
when
we
got
to
her
a
little
ball
of
pain
in
the
grass
I
called
one
of
my
friends
from
the
chain
We
talked
a
long
time
about
how
terrible
it
was
and
how
terrible
we
d
been
as
a
couple
of
LSU
frat
boys
how
we
d
never
done
a
thing
but
chase
girls
and
get
blasted
how
we
d
never
so
much
as
thought
to
wonder
what
it
might
be
like
to
be
anyone
other
than
us
We
both
did
and
said
things
we
shouldn
t
have
I
said
My
friend
sighed
When
I
look
back
on
the
guy
I
was
I
don
t
feel
proud
By
the
time
our
call
ended
the
booze
in
my
blood
had
become
self-righteous
You
know
I
typed
on
the
original
chain
if
the
police
found
my
drunk
ass
passed
out
in
a
car
and
I
tried
to
run
or
do
anything
even
halfway
threatening
no
cop
in
America
would
ever
shoot
me
I
hit
send
and
geared
up
for
an
argument
but
before
long
I
passed
out
When
I
came
to
hours
later
sweaty
and
confused
and
still
on
the
porch
no
one
had
replied
I
made
my
way
to
the
door
which
was
somehow
locked
My
wife
had
been
asleep
for
hours
a
reasonable
human
being
getting
rest
before
another
day
of
work
without
childcare
I
pictured
her
wrapped
in
the
sheets
snoring
softly
and
my
whole
self
filled
with
rage
Sleeping
outside
struck
me
as
the
ultimate
indignity
I
pounded
the
windows
until
I
thought
the
glass
might
shatter
Goddamnit
I
screamed
into
the
night
You
re
so
fucking
…
annoying
When
my
wife
got
up
to
let
me
in
she
spoke
only
one
sentence
You
know
you
locked
yourself
out
right
On
the
Fourth
of
July
we
made
our
way
to
my
wife
s
aunt
s
place
just
a
short
walk
from
the
townhouse
After
scrambled
egg
casserole
and
fruit
salad
we
gathered
on
the
porch
to
watch
the
parade
As
we
sipped
mimosas
James
Habersham
Street
came
alive
in
a
chain
of
tipsy
white
people
in
golf
carts
done
up
in
patriotic
crepe
paper
and
Uncle
Sam
balloons
Families
along
either
side
of
the
oak-lined
road
shouted
and
waved
and
as
my
older
son
hopped
from
one
foot
to
the
other
unable
to
contain
his
thrill
about
another
holiday
that
to
him
meant
nothing
I
refilled
my
mimosa
and
looked
at
my
phone
It
hadn
t
occurred
to
me
until
then
to
wonder
who
James
Habersham
was
but
a
quick
Google
yielded
that
he
was
not
only
a
slave
owner
but
a
slave
owner
against
American
independence
As
the
parade
rolled
and
the
champagne
settled
I
thought
of
making
a
comment
or
at
least
a
joke
something
to
acknowledge
the
absurdity
Here
we
were
Americans
celebrating
America
by
watching
rich
Americans
cruise
along
a
road
named
for
a
person
who
not
only
loved
slavery
but
hated
America
Not
a
single
reveler
wore
a
mask
Not
a
single
placard
bore
any
slogan
reminding
us
to
KEEP
OUR
DISTANCE
or
REMEMBER
GEORGE
FLOYD
or
RAYSHARD
BROOKS
And
where
are
their
families
I
wanted
to
ask
What
are
they
up
to
this
Independence
Day
And
everyone
on
ventilators
what
about
them
and
the
people
they
love
But
then
the
parade
ended
and
the
bar
shut
down
I
packed
the
boys
into
the
stroller
for
the
eighty-billionth
time
and
began
to
dread
the
hours
ahead
It
was
barely
11
a.
m.
and
I
was
drunk
and
dehydrated
and
deeply
tired
with
hours
to
go
before
naptime
I
sighed
a
long
sigh
unlocked
the
brake
and
slowly
pushed
my
children
home
If
you
hang
around
the
pool
long
enough
you
re
bound
to
make
friends
and
as
July
drew
to
a
close
we
did
just
that
Jason
and
Jenna
were
our
age
and
had
a
set
of
twin
boys
right
between
our
sons
After
a
handful
of
afternoons
swimming
and
chatting
Jenna
invited
us
to
join
them
for
a
twilight
boat
ride
To
be
clear
Jenna
said
this
is
a
booze
cruise
The
day
of
I
kept
catching
myself
feeling
nervous
it
d
been
so
long
since
we
d
hung
out
with
a
new
couple
I
might
not
know
how
to
act
My
solution
was
drinking
That
afternoon
on
our
walk
to
the
pool
I
guzzled
a
huge
rosé
then
tore
through
IPAs
with
total
abandon
By
the
time
we
got
to
Jenna
and
Jason
s
it
was
already
too
late
The
night
itself
was
gorgeous
Jason
zoomed
us
out
past
the
marsh
and
into
the
open
water
where
we
bobbed
together
eating
fancy
cheese
and
pounding
red
wine
We
motored
about
in
the
blue-gray
night
my
wife
leaning
into
me
the
whole
time
a
smile
on
her
face
enjoying
a
perfect
evening
with
her
husband
in
such
a
pretty
place
But
the
deal
of
my
blackout
was
already
sealed
I
kept
up
the
banter
as
long
as
I
could
trading
stories
about
my
years
in
New
Orleans
about
writing
and
teaching
but
by
the
time
we
got
back
to
dry
land
I
could
no
longer
be
counted
on
to
get
my
thoughts
from
my
head
to
my
mouth
I
could
be
counted
on
only
for
the
insane
sense
that
no
matter
what
I
needed
to
keep
drinking
As
the
night
ended
and
we
made
our
way
back
to
Jason
and
Jenna
s
I
invited
myself
in
for
a
nightcap
a
drink
I
ll
never
recall
In
my
wife
s
telling
we
didn
t
stay
long
and
though
I
didn
t
make
a
fool
of
myself
I
did
go
completely
silent
staring
up
at
the
night
sky
and
slugging
back
beer
Once
we
d
gotten
home
I
assumed
I
d
made
a
beeline
to
pass
out
but
instead
I
hunched
like
an
animal
at
the
kitchen
island
gorging
myself
on
whatever
I
pulled
from
the
fridge
I
woke
the
next
dawn
with
the
scum
of
chips
and
pork
chops
on
my
tongue
and
no
recall
of
how
the
night
ended
My
brain
made
a
million
scenarios
I
d
made
some
lewd
comment
to
Jesse
I
d
pissed
my
pants
or
exposed
myself
Like
always
none
of
these
things
had
happened
But
like
always
the
shame
in
my
chest
could
not
have
felt
heavier
Everywhere
you
go
you
embarrass
yourself
I
whispered
in
bed
before
my
wife
came
in
Every
time
you
meet
someone
you
show
them
you
re
a
fool
III
Somehow
it
got
worse
I
started
cracking
bottles
of
rosé
at
3
p.
m.
then
2:30
I
could
no
longer
have
just
a
beer
on
the
way
to
the
pool
I
couldn
t
be
counted
on
to
form
a
sentence
after
sundown
I
began
to
avoid
my
wife
in
favor
of
sweating
alone
on
the
porch
pounding
wine
and
FaceTiming
friends
friends
who
stopped
answering
At
some
point
my
wife
started
to
film
me
her
sad
subject
in
his
sad
little
TV
chair
eyes
glazed
face
slack
grunting
and
swatting
at
her
phone
when
I
realized
what
she
was
doing
On
the
last
day
of
July
after
my
in-laws
and
I
took
my
wife
out
for
her
38th
birthday
our
first
time
in
a
restaurant
since
the
pandemic
began
my
wife
and
I
put
the
boys
to
bed
Earlier
that
afternoon
we
d
gone
to
the
liquor
store
and
carefully
selected
four
bottles
of
nice
wine
and
as
my
wife
yawned
and
began
to
wind
down
she
asked
me
nicely
not
to
drink
it
It
s
good
stuff
she
said
I
agreed
We
should
save
it
for
having
people
over
I
agreed
And
then
she
went
to
sleep
There
are
no
memories
Only
flashes
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
call
a
friend
who
does
not
answer
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
call
another
friend
who
does
not
answer
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
switch
on
a
movie
I
m
too
drunk
to
watch
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
hit
FaceTime
on
my
college
text
chain
and
somehow
connect
with
all
of
them
at
once
on
video
and
watch
as
their
faces
crumble
from
looks
of
excitement
to
looks
of
fret
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
Once
we
d
gotten
home
I
assumed
I
d
made
a
beeline
to
pass
out
but
instead
I
hunched
like
an
animal
at
the
kitchen
island
gorging
myself
on
whatever
I
pulled
from
the
fridge
Time
is
gone
I
feel
no
feelings
a
man
hiding
from
himself
I
get
more
wine
I
get
more
wine
I
am
a
man
failing
The
next
morning
light
streamed
through
the
shutters
and
bathed
the
wreck
of
me
in
a
soft
warm
glow
When
my
wife
came
in
she
did
not
speak
did
not
have
to
so
clear
was
the
pain
in
her
eyes
I
m
finished
I
said
The
words
came
without
thought
My
wife
looked
out
the
windows
I
m
finished
I
said
again
I
ll
never
quite
know
why
it
happened
then
Why
not
the
day
prior
or
10
years
back
Why
not
never
All
I
know
is
if
you
re
a
person
surrounded
by
love
you
re
lucky
All
I
know
is
if
you
re
a
drunk
you
either
stop
drinking
or
you
die
a
drunk
I
stood
poured
coffee
and
rubbed
the
heads
of
my
two
children
I
kissed
their
fat
cheeks
and
made
for
the
porch
I
phoned
my
brother-
and
sister-in-law
then
my
in-laws
I
m
sorry
I
said
and
they
said
they
loved
me
I
lost
myself
I
said
and
they
said
that
I
had
I
held
my
wife
and
said
over
and
over
how
ashamed
I
was
I
m
sorry
I
m
sorry
I
m
sorry
Later
that
morning
we
drove
the
boys
to
Port
Royal
where
there
was
a
grubby
beach
but
a
beach
nonetheless
They
called
it
the
Redneck
Riviera
Once
the
kids
lost
themselves
stomping
in
tide
pools
and
chasing
tiny
crabs
I
drifted
to
the
parking
lot
and
pulled
out
my
phone
I
hammered
out
a
text
to
all
my
close
friends
After
a
bad
few
months
I
ve
made
the
decision
to
quit
drinking
I
m
not
going
to
AA
I
am
just
tired
of
being
this
version
of
myself
I
can
not
be
a
drunk
while
raising
these
boys
I
know
I
have
your
support
The
replies
came
fast
and
though
every
person
said
it
differently
every
message
was
the
same
This
is
good
This
is
right
We
love
you
You
will
never
regret
this
one
friend
said
Yeah
I
said
but
what
about
–
You
will
never
regret
this
he
said
again
The
sun
moved
shadows
lengthened
There
was
a
breeze
and
seafoam
and
the
crashing
of
waves
My
wife
watched
the
children
and
I
watched
my
wife
The
wine
burned
in
my
veins
and
my
head
throbbed
but
once
it
was
done
I
told
myself
it
d
be
done
for
good
I
d
endured
nearly
six
months
of
self-destruction
I
saw
then
I
had
no
plan
for
where
to
go
from
here
but
in
my
heart
scared
and
bruised
though
it
was
I
knew
it
didn
t
matter
All
that
mattered
was
I
was
here
All
that
mattered
was
I
was
having
this
moment
We
ve
been
talking
about
coming
here
all
summer
my
wife
said
as
we
strapped
the
boys
back
in
their
car
seats
Well
I
m
glad
we
finally
made
it
Yeah
she
said
Me
too
Days
later
sober
as
a
judge
before
my
laptop
in
the
townhouse
s
dining
room
a
room
where
few
meals
had
been
eaten
but
where
I
d
written
through
hangovers
all
summer
long
I
logged
in
for
my
first
session
with
a
therapist
My
counselor
a
hardy
and
whip-smart
Harley-Davidson
enthusiast
comically
named
Dr
Bliss
told
me
all
the
ways
she
could
help
me
and
as
she
neared
the
end
of
her
spiel
she
paused
So
how
old
are
you
she
asked
Thirty-five
And
who
will
you
be
at
50
My
mind
did
the
math
My
son
I
said
My
older
son
will
be
a
senior
in
high
school
She
smiled
But
who
will
you
be
The
right
answers
were
obvious
Sober
A
better
husband
and
dad
and
writer
But
what
I
said
was
I
just
want
to
be
a
person
who
loves
himself
A
person
who
gives
love
I
want
to
know
why
I
ve
hurt
myself
for
so
many
years
She
nodded
and
laughed
What
s
funny
You
re
so
introspective
And
hard
on
yourself
I
guess
I
m
just
wondering
why
it
took
you
so
long
to
start
therapy
I
answered
without
thinking
Because
I
knew
they
d
tell
me
to
quit
drinking
IV
At
summer
s
end
my
family
my
wife
s
family
and
all
the
kids
and
grandkids
made
the
trip
north
for
a
week
in
Cape
May
New
Jersey
In
our
days
there
wrangling
toddlers
beside
the
Atlantic
wandering
from
one
rental
to
the
next
in
an
endless
loop
of
family
lunches
happy
hours
and
dinners
I
never
once
brought
up
my
choice
to
quit
I
chased
my
sons
on
the
beach
made
chitchat
over
dinner
without
wine
by
my
plate
and
brimmed
glass
after
glass
with
fizzy
water
and
lime
One
morning
while
everyone
else
loaded
carts
with
sunscreen
and
plastic
pails
for
another
day
on
the
shore
I
drove
two
hours
back
to
our
campus
home
to
supervise
while
movers
got
all
our
belongings
back
into
place
The
new
A/C
outpaced
the
August
heat
with
ease
and
as
I
watched
a
crew
of
burly
tattooed
dudes
lug
sofas
and
cribs
around
corners
and
up
stairs
I
had
the
sense
that
all
that
d
happened
here
the
pandemic
the
beginning
of
my
bad
days
had
been
erased
Must
be
weird
the
crew
boss
said
Moving
back
into
your
old
place
My
man
I
told
him
you
have
no
idea
Our
final
morning
in
Cape
May
was
nothing
special
just
harried
people
scrambling
to
pack
Everyone
was
hungover
and
grumpy
Everyone
except
for
me
Down
in
the
garage
we
said
goodbye
to
my
mother-
and
father-in-law
my
brother-
and
sister-in-law
and
their
two
little
girls
We
did
one
final
sweep
and
made
for
the
Subaru
I
started
the
engine
and
looked
at
my
wife
Are
we
ready
I
think
so
she
said
And
we
were
The
boys
were
strapped
in
we
had
plenty
of
masks
and
Raffi
shouted
from
the
speakers
Now
s
the
time
to
rise
and
shine
We
re
going
home
I
thought
and
for
that
I
was
thankful
Now
all
I
had
to
do
was
live
the
rest
of
my
life

By
A
H
Reaume
My
first
subscription
to
Bitch
Magazine
was
a
gift
I
was
in
my
second
year
of
university
and
couldn
t
afford
to
subscribe
So
when
my
sister
asked
what
I
wanted
for
my
birthday
the
answer
was
easy
I
d
attended
Catholic
schools
my
whole
life
By
the
time
I
was
19
I
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
the
church
because
of
its
stance
on
abortion
and
queer
rights
But
I
wasn
t
exactly
sure
what
my
politics
were
I
was
definitely
a
feminist
that
much
I
knew
I
was
interested
in
social
justice
but
I
didn
t
really
know
what
was
possible
to
believe
politically
Growing
up
all
I
had
been
exposed
to
were
conservative
and
right-leaning
liberal
views
But
I
knew
I
wanted
more
More
rights
for
women
more
rights
for
LGTBQIA+
folks
more
rights
for
disabled
people
more
rights
for
racialized
people
and
more
economic
equality
Enter
Bitch
I
d
heard
about
the
magazine
on
feminist
blogs
like
Feministing
and
Pandagon
both
of
which
I
read
avidly
trying
to
map
and
shape
my
own
politics
I
searched
for
Bitch
on
the
magazine
racks
of
every
bookstore
I
visited
and
I
couldn
t
believe
it
when
I
finally
saw
a
physical
copy
of
the
magazine
on
a
shelf
in
a
women
s
bookstore
in
Vancouver
British
Columbia
My
breath
caught
I
remember
approaching
it
with
reverence
and
being
absorbed
in
its
pages
before
buying
it
along
with
two
back
issues
There
was
something
seductive
about
holding
these
magazines
written
for
feminists
in
my
hands
At
home
I
consumed
them
front
to
back
in
one
sitting
Everything
the
magazine
represented
went
against
what
I
d
learned
growing
up
I
felt
exhilarated
I
was
already
on
a
feminist
journey
when
I
encountered
Bitch
but
the
magazine
sparked
new
thoughts
It
deepened
my
analysis
For
a
women
s
studies
class
in
my
third
year
I
did
a
creative
project
inspired
by
an
article
in
Bitch
that
examined
the
ways
my
Catholic
school
education
had
harmed
me
The
publication
introduced
me
to
books
and
musicians
that
have
since
shaped
me
But
perhaps
more
importantly
it
showed
me
the
power
of
media
What
if
we
started
a
magazine
I
asked
my
friend
Kristen
three
years
after
becoming
a
Bitch
subscriber
We
had
been
talking
about
a
female
politician
who
d
recently
been
called
a
bimbo
in
the
media
because
she
had
long
blonde
hair
It
felt
to
us
like
women
couldn
t
win
when
it
came
to
power
and
we
were
discussing
how
angry
that
made
us
and
how
we
both
felt
powerless
to
change
it
Oh
I
like
that
idea
Kristen
responded
A
magazine
to
talk
about
feminism
and
the
challenges
women
face
in
relation
to
power
That
was
how
Antigone
Magazine
was
born
We
recruited
a
number
of
other
feminists
we
knew
and
together
we
named
the
publication
Antigone
inspired
by
the
Greek
figure
s
courage
and
determination
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
Through
the
magazine
we
wanted
to
help
young
women
express
and
do
what
they
thought
was
right
even
in
the
face
of
opposition
or
punishment
simply
because
they
were
women
We
wanted
to
embody
that
kind
of
defiance
Like
Bitch
we
wanted
to
reclaim
the
identity
of
the
troublemaker
We
published
Antigone
Magazine
on
our
campus
and
periodically
on
other
campuses
It
had
an
international
subscription
base
We
even
started
an
art
project
called
Dreams
for
Women
curating
and
posting
collaged
postcards
from
around
the
world
with
people
s
secret
hopes
for
women
on
them
The
project
was
featured
in
the
International
Museum
of
Women
The
group
of
women
that
became
involved
with
Antigone
over
the
years
organized
women
s
forums
and
a
national
conference
on
childcare
and
post-secondary
education
In
2008
I
was
invited
by
the
Governor
General
of
Canada
to
speak
about
women
and
politics
in
Ottawa
and
in
2009
was
also
part
of
a
Canadian
delegation
to
a
United
Nations
meeting
on
the
status
of
women
The
magazine
was
even
mentioned
in
a
textbook
on
women
s
history
We
re
no
longer
publishing
Antigone
but
it
s
still
making
an
impact
A
few
years
ago
one
of
our
subscribers
ran
for
office
and
told
me
Antigone
inspired
her
Recently
one
of
our
writers
published
a
book
about
foreign
policy
Another
person
is
the
managing
editor
of
a
national
news
agency
Some
of
us
became
teachers
Others
academics
Still
more
activists
We
haven
t
stopped
demanding
more
for
women
Bitch
will
soon
join
Antigone
in
the
graveyard
of
feminist
publications
Started
in
1996
by
Andi
Zeisler
Benjamin
Shaykin
and
Lisa
Jervis
Bitch
Media
announced
on
April
12
2022
that
it
would
cease
operations
in
June
The
announcement
hit
many
of
its
loyal
readers
hard
My
own
feminist
journey
along
with
those
of
the
phenomenal
women
who
collaborated
with
me
on
Antigone
are
the
types
of
stories
you
hear
when
people
talk
about
Bitch
The
publication
sparked
awakenings
Activism
Community
Change
It
was
loved
for
its
resolutely
queer
perspectives
its
intersectional
coverage
its
engagement
with
disability
justice
and
its
integration
of
economic
justice
The
magazine
talked
about
things
no
other
outlets
were
talking
about
and
pushed
the
conversation
forward
Many
even
credit
Bitch
with
making
space
for
other
popular
feminist
media
like
Jezebel
and
Teen
Vogue
But
as
people
appraise
the
media
organization
s
legacy
it
is
not
without
criticism
including
the
contention
that
for
all
their
coverage
of
labor
rights
the
magazine
worked
its
editors
and
writers
to
exhaustion
What
those
criticisms
show
is
that
even
as
the
magazine
is
shuttering
the
people
who
made
Bitch
great
are
still
leading
important
conversations
that
will
help
make
culture
work
and
feminist
media
better
Despite
its
organizational
challenges
Bitch
gave
voice
to
so
many
amazing
writers
it
s
their
work
I
want
to
celebrate
In
this
reading
list
I
ve
compiled
10
recommended
longreads
that
represent
some
of
the
best
of
Bitch
Magazine
over
the
years
And
since
the
organization
s
archives
will
remain
online
for
the
foreseeable
future
you
can
dig
into
and
re
discover
your
own
favorites
from
the
publication
too
In
light
of
the
recent
leak
of
Justice
Samuel
A
Alito
Jr.
s
draft
opinion
that
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
SCOTUS
has
voted
internally
to
overturn
Roe
v
Wade
one
thing
that
I
keep
returning
to
is
how
much
feminist
labor
went
into
trying
to
ensure
this
day
never
came
Much
of
that
labor
was
covered
or
inspired
by
Bitch
So
while
SCOTUS
could
still
choose
to
let
Roe
v
Wade
stand
there
is
something
deeply
tragic
about
the
shutdown
of
Bitch
in
a
time
when
we
urgently
need
feminist
media
I
want
to
recognize
the
work
the
magazine
has
done
in
the
past
on
reproductive
justice
including
looking
at
how
abortion
rights
were
co-opted
by
white
feminists
and
the
assault
on
the
reproductive
rights
of
refugees
and
immigrants
This
particular
piece
rounds
up
great
coverage
on
the
arguments
in
Dobbs
v
Jackson
from
when
the
case
went
before
the
courts
in
December
2021
and
what
action
you
can
take
If
you
re
someone
who
cares
about
protecting
the
right
to
bodily
autonomy
in
general
and
abortion
access
in
particular
you
re
already
aware
that
this
morning
s
oral
arguments
to
the
Supreme
Court
in
Dobbs
v
Jackson
are
the
culmination
of
a
decades-long
conservative
strategy
to
overturn
1973
s
historic
Roe
v
Wade
decision
But
that
doesn
t
mean
it
wasn
t
profoundly
unsettling
to
watch
the
nation
s
most
powerful
legal
body
debate
questions
that
should
be
easy
to
answer
Does
the
U.
S
government
have
the
right
to
force
a
person
to
carry
an
unwanted
pregnancy
to
term
Even
if
that
pregnancy
poses
a
serious
health
risk
Even
if
the
pregnancy
isn
t
viable
Even
if
the
pregnancy
itself
is
the
result
of
a
crime
Even
if
the
outcome
is
guaranteed
to
be
bad
for
the
humans
involved
Dr
Chandra
Prescod-Weinstein
s
2021
book
The
Disordered
Cosmos
A
Journey
into
Dark
Matter
Spacetime
and
Dreams
Deferred
took
the
world
by
storm
In
it
Prescod-Weinstein
explores
the
physics
of
melanin
in
skin
and
gives
an
overview
of
the
racism
and
misogyny
of
the
scientific
community
She
first
wrote
about
the
topic
in
Bitch
Magazine
This
piece
shows
how
the
publication
offered
many
writers
their
first
chance
to
explore
topics
that
would
later
create
significant
impact
Hundreds
of
years
after
the
advent
of
chattel
slavery
it
s
easy
to
see
why
race
is
defined
by
skin
color
Skin
color
offers
a
highly
visible
cue
that
makes
sorting
easy—at
least
until
rape
proliferates
The
variation
in
human
skin
tones
is
due
to
a
pigment
called
melanin
which
comes
from
the
Greek
word
melas
black
dark
Melanin
is
found
in
most
living
creatures
and
when
it
is
studied
scientifically
researchers
usually
use
the
ink
of
Sepia
officinalis
the
common
cuttlefish
Our
social
sorting
by
skin
color
can
be
put
in
more
technical
terms
as
a
question
of
how
much
melanin
our
bodies
produce
and
maintain
as
part
of
our
epidermic
structure
As
a
disabled
person
who
spent
the
first
four
years
of
their
recovery
from
a
debilitating
injury
single
and
who
has
many
beloved
single
disabled
friends
I
am
obsessed
with
articles
that
explore
care
work
outside
romantic
relationships
I
ve
read
Caleb
Luna
s
iconic
essay
Romantic
Love
is
Killing
Us
Who
Takes
Care
of
Us
When
We
re
Single
more
times
than
I
can
count
and
about
10
books
on
the
future
of
care
In
2021
Oliver
Haug
added
to
the
conversation
in
this
critical
essay
that
explores
this
important
issue
in
light
of
the
pandemic
After
a
year
that
s
laid
painfully
bare
inequities
and
oppressions
that
have
always
been
there
the
systemic
change
that
s
at
the
core
of
rewriting
love
still
feels
far
out
of
reach
…
The
way
out
offered
by
Luna
and
Kim
as
well
as
many
others
working
in
this
field
is
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
necessity
of
interdependence
in
relationships
beyond
our
romantic
ones
With
a
restructuring
of
romantic
love
as
comparable
to
community/platonic/self-love
we
begin
to
prioritize
the
care
and
livelihood
of
entire
larger
groups
of
people
as
equally
important
as
our
romantic
partner/s
writes
Luna
There
are
few
outlets
that
cover
fatphobia
as
well
as
Bitch
Magazine
did
But
then
a
feminist
magazine
that
purports
to
engage
in
cultural
criticism
that
didn
t
respond
to
fatphobia
wouldn
t
be
doing
its
job
well
Claudia
Cortese
s
essay
tackles
the
widespread
effort
by
public
health
officials
to
restrict
or
prohibit
fat
or
disabled
people
from
accessing
the
limited
supply
of
ventilators
during
COVID-19
waves
The
piece
does
the
important
work
of
exploring
the
deadly
impact
of
fatphobia
Some
doctors
not
only
have
an
aversion
to
patients
of
size
but
they
assume
a
fat
body
is
inherently
a
sick
body
this
mode
of
thinking
encourages
health
professionals
to
overlook
symptoms
of
disease
not
offer
treatment
and
focus
solely
on
ridding
the
body
of
fat
For
example
a
2015
study
of
medical
students
found
they
were
nearly
four
times
more
likely
to
prescribe
medication
to
thin
patients
than
to
fat
patients
though
both
groups
had
the
same
symptoms
The
supposed
relationship
between
fatness
and
health
concerns
likely
exists
due
to
widespread
weight
bias
While
it
seems
that
more
people
know
about
prison
abolitionism
these
days
in
2015
that
wasn
t
the
case

and
others
It
is
an
inspiring
essay
that
makes
you
rethink
both
what
social
justice
organizing
and
speculative
fiction
are
and
do
We
started
the
anthology
with
the
belief
that
all
organizing
is
science
fiction
When
we
talk
about
a
world
without
prisons
a
world
without

violence
a
world
where
everyone
has
food
clothing
shelter
quality
education
a
world
free
of
white
supremacy
patriarchy
capitalism

we
are
talking
about
a
world
that
doesn

currently
exist
But
collectively
dreaming
up
one
that
does
means
we
can
begin
building
it
into
existence

There

real
failure
to

is
a

experience
other
aspects
of
life
can
interact
with

that
the

offers
a
more
intersectional
approach
I
grew
up
watching
Sailor
Moon
I
loved
that
she
was
awkward
like
me
and
that
she
presented
a
very
different
example
of
a
girl
than
what
I
was
used
to
seeing
in
cartoons
I
also
loved
that
she
wanted
to
right
wrongs
and
understood
her
desire
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
I
really
love
this
piece
by
Soleil
Ho
who
writes
about
her
own
ambivalent
feelings
about
girlhood
and
Girl
Power
and
her
turn
to
Sailor
Moon
for
a
glimpse
into
a
beautifully
imperfect
heroine
I
realize
now
that
being
a
girl
or
identifying
as
one
is
one
of
the
hardest
roles
to
inhabit
in
this
world
A
girl
is
supposed
to
be
so
many
things
attractive
graceful
polite
quiet
valuable
valueless
but
none
of
those
traits
guarantee
that
she
ll
be
taken
seriously
as
a
thinking
and
feeling
human
being
On
the
other
hand
the
absence
of
those
traits
can
often
invite
violence
or
at
the
very
least
judgment
When
we
say
that
all
girls
are
powerful
we
often
refrain
from
explaining
just
what
kind
of
power
we
re
talking
about
The
power
that
I
want
girls
to
have
certainly
includes
the
power
to
govern
their
own
bodies
but
also
something
else
entirely
Sailor
Moon
isn
t
just
fighting
aliens
but
a
world
of
adults
who
want
to
destroy
everything
beautiful
in
girls
In
order
to
save
the
people
she
loves
she
fights
and
gets
hurt
and
breaks
down
and
even
completely
fails
at
times
And
when
she
can
manage
it
she
tries
to
save
the
monsters
too
In
this
powerful
exploration
of
trans
women
s
writing
Katherine
Cross
discusses
how
work
emerging
at
the
time
the
piece
was
written
was
full
of
joy
love
laughter
sex
and
deep
wells
of
human
flourishing
amid
the
gloom
It
highlights
writers
like
Casey
Plett
Sybil
Lamb
and
Olympia
Perez
and
talks
about
writing
that
paints
a
picture
of
the
everyday
experiences
of
trans
women
that
isn
t
inspiration
porn
or
a
feel-good
story
of
triumph
over
lone
bigots
Just
read
the
piece
Then
read
the
works
it
cites
This
is
trans
women
s
moment
in
modern
literature
and
amid
the
many
currents
of
transgender
existence
today
it
is
singular
So
much
discourse
around
trans
women
s
existence
has
been
spun
by
everyone
but
us
cisgender
male
psychologists
cis
feminist
academics
trans
men
and
queer
cis
people
All
have
had
their
say
about
our
lives
and
what
they
supposedly
signify
to
them
protean
radicalism
a
crypto-conservative
conspiracy
a
tangle
of
pathology
But
it
is
very
rare
that
trans
women
themselves
are
heard
when
we
speak
about
who
we
are
and
what
we
mean
What
emerges
from
all
of
these
works
is
a
clear
picture
of
trans
women
as
human
beings
thinkers
and
artists
with
mastery
and
control
over
the
kinds
of
stories
they
wish
to
tell
Neither
genderfucking
superheroines
nor
the
nightmare
of
queer
radicalism
we
are
at
last
human
At
a
time
when
trans-exclusionary
radical
feminists
are
resurging
I
wanted
to
return
to
this
article
by
Tina
Vasquez
which
talks
about
the
history
of
trans
exclusion
in
feminist
movements
and
calls
on
cisgender
feminists
to
take
more
responsibility
for
fighting
transphobia
That
s
the
thing
about
Bitch
It
wasn
t
just
a
magazine
that
asked
us
to
think
only
of
our
own
liberation
it
asked
its
readers
to
think
about
how
we
could
fight
for
each
other
s
freedom
The
magazine
made
all
its
readers
better
feminists
by
teaching
us
how
to
be
better
allies
to
each
other
Trans
women
have
been
saddled
with
the
responsibility
of
taking
on
trans-exclusionary
feminists
for
far
too
long—but
it
s
not
their
issue
to
deal
with
alone
Cisgender
feminists
such
as
myself
have
to
make
it
clear
that
our
feminism
loves
and
supports
trans
women
and
that
we
will
fight
against
transphobia
As
Williams
said
it
s
time
to
expose
trans-exclusionary
feminists
for
who
they
really
are

of
The
Creative
Nonfiction
Podcast
Brendan
O
Meara
is
no
stranger
to
talking
about
the
art
and
craft
of
storytelling
In
this
craft-focused
excerpt
we
re
digging
into
Episode
313
in
which
he
interviewed
Atavist
editor-in-chief
Seyward
Darby
and
writer
Katia
Savchuk
about
their
work
on
the
latest
issue
of
The
Atavist
Why
don
t
we
copy
the
work
of
writers
we
admire
more
Don
t
plagiarize
duh
but
when
it
comes
to
practicing
our
scales
why
aren
t
we
retyping
more
work
of
the
masters
After
all
the
masters
did
this
Hunter
S
Thompson
famously
typed
up
the
work
of
F
Scott
Fitzgerald
Ernest
Hemingway
and
William
Faulkner
Joan
Didion
did
the
same
Now
add
to
that
list
Katia
Savchuk
the
freelance
journalist
who
wrote
The
Atavist
s
latest
feature
A
Crime
Beyond
Belief
Katia
who
s
based
in
the
Bay
Area
routinely
copies
the
work
of
the
New
Yorker
writer
David
Grann
someone
she
greatly
admires
I
found
it
to
be
an
amazing
practice
she
says
First
of
all
it
gets
your
hands
flowing
the
words
flowing
instead
of
just
sitting
down
with
your
own
text
a
blank
page
It
s
almost
like
running
a
few
laps
to
give
your
fingers
something
to
do
Before
my
conversation
with
Katia
Atavist
editor-in-chief
Seyward
Darby
speaks
of
wrangling
in
Katia
s
piece
a
19,000-word
story
that
demanded
a
tricky
structure
The
key
wasn
t
merely
organization
but
pace
trying
to
think
about
how
we
can
order
…
the
story
such
that
the
reader
never
feels
like
‘
I
have
everything
I
came
for
why
are
there
still
10,000
words
left
Figuring
out
that
structure
where
things
didn
t
really
feel
front-loaded
was
maybe
the
most
important
decision
we
had
to
make
And
later
Katia
digs
into
how
she
kept
it
all
straight
the
transcripts
the
photos
her
notes
everything
to
tackle
this
ambitious
riveting
account
of
a
series
of
bizarre
home
invasions
and
the
Harvard-trained
lawyer
convicted
of
committing
them
A
Crime
Beyond
Belief
was
more
than
four
years
in
the
making
so
please
enjoy
this
excerpt
from
Episode

These
interviews
have
been
edited
for
clarity
and
concision
Brendan
O
Meara
What
really
struck
you
about
Katia
s
story
when
it
came
across
your
desk
Seyward
Darby
The
story
s
about
a
kidnapping
that
police
in
Vallejo
California
initially
said
was
a
hoax
It
was
sensational
at
the
time
It
was
in
the
national
news
wound
up
on
Dateline
and
Nancy
Grace
all
that
kind
of
stuff
And
so
we
re
not
the
first
to
tell
the
story
But
what
Katia
has
done
here
is
gone
deep
into
what
happened
who
was
involved
and
how
so
many
things
went
wrong
but
then
ultimately
were
also
made
right
We
wanted
to
take
the
readers
on
a
revelatory
journey
to
go
along
with
some
of
the
characters
as
they
encountered
information
and
had
to
decide
what
was
true
and
what
wasn
t
So
there
s
a
little
bit
of
puzzle-piecing
that
the
piece
itself
shows
happening
It
s
a
really
complicated
twisty
piece
and
definitely
one
where
structure
was
not
a
given
When
she
turned
in
the
first
draft
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
kind
of
staring
at
it
and
writing
notes
on
Post-its
and
trying
to
think
about
how
we
can
order
them
in
the
story
such
that
the
reader
never
feels
like
I
have
everything
I
came
for
why
are
there
still
10,000
words
left
Figuring
out
that
structure
where
things
didn
t
really
feel
front-loaded
was
maybe
the
most
important
decision
we
had
to
make
Trying
to
figure
out
you
know
how
to
not
just
organize
things
but
pace
things
Pace
was
just
really
really
crucial
here
Anytime
that
a
reporter
is
brought
into
a
story
as
a
character
I
always
love
reading
that
dynamic
and
how
a
reporter
is
writing
about
a
reporter
in
a
story
like
this
Henry
Lee
the
San
Francisco
Chronicle
reporter
is
such
an
interesting
subject
A
lot
of
the
events
in
the
story
for
the
most
part
went
down
in
2015
And
he
says
you
know
we
were
kind
of
just
at
the
beginning
of
a
reckoning
about
law
enforcement
and
how
to
approach
them
as
reporters
The
other
thing
that
s
really
important
to
remember
here
is
How
often
do
you
hear
cops
publicly
say
something
like
we
think
this
kidnapping
was
a
hoax
Lee
points
out
that
that
s
just
an
insane
thing
to
claim
and
have
it
not
be
true
That
s
definitely
a
tension
in
the
piece
once
you
know
everything
you
re
like
how
could
they
ever
say
that
it
was
a
hoax
But
if
you
re
on
the
receiving
end
of
that
information
I
don
t
know
if
we
would
call
it
a
biased
assumption
or
a
human
assumption
but
you
think
well
that
has
to
be
true
Like
why
else
would
they
claim
something
so
outlandish
That
s
obviously
a
flaw
but
it
s
an
interesting
one
because
I
do
think
that
there
are
moments
in
the
story
where
you
know
as
journalists
you
can
take
a
step
back
and
say
Well
yeah
I
guess
I
get
why
that
might
happen
Several
years
ago
I
pitched
a
story
to
you
for
The
Atavist
and
I
remember
you
coming
at
me
like
this
feels
like
there
should
be
a
Big
Fish
element
to
it
You
brought
that
movie
sensibility
to
it
which
I
thought
was
really
intriguing
I
bring
that
up
only
to
say
that
in
this
piece
there
was
this
Gone
Girl
element
that
was
dropped
into
this
piece
and
it
made
me
wonder
if
you
d
put
that
on
Katia
s
radar
Maybe
you
could
speak
to
how
sometimes
you
use
those
movies
as
a
way
to
crack
the
code
of
a
piece
that
s
coming
across
your
desk
That
s
a
great
question
In
this
case
I
didn
t
have
to
bring
up
Gone
Girl
because
the
police
were
the
ones
who
brought
up
Gone
Girl
They
were
the
ones
who
were
telling
this
woman
s
family
before
she
had
been
returned
by
the
kidnapper
we
think
this
is
being
faked
You
should
go
watch
Gone
Girl
which
had
just
come
out
a
couple
of
months
prior
the
David
Fincher
adaptation
of
the
Gillian
Flynn
book
Nancy
Grace
called
her
the
real-life
Gone
Girl
or
something
along
those
lines
In
that
case
the
cinematic
story
was
almost
part
of
the
problem
right
People
looked
at
the
situation
and
for
whatever
reason
decided
okay
we
actually
think
the
thing
that
s
happening
in
real
life
sounds
a
whole
lot
like
this
thing
in
a
book
And
so
we
re
gon
na
start
calling
it
that
And
that
obviously
did
a
tremendous
disservice
to
the
couple
at
the
heart
of
this
entire
story
But
you
re
absolutely
right
Oftentimes
I
m
thinking
through
stories
and
thinking
how
can
we
make
this
more
cinematic
As
you
were
asking
the
question
I
was
like
What
movie
would
I
compare
the
story
to
as
Katia
put
it
together
I
m
gon
na
have
to
think
about
that
for
a
second
Maybe
by
the
end
of
us
talking
I
ll
have
a
good
comparison
I
know
it
doesn
t
run
backwards
but
in
a
sense
because
it
s
a
slow
exposure
like
a
Polaroid
coming
into
focus
it
kind
of
makes
me
think
of
Memento
I
think
describing
it
as
like
a
Polaroid
coming
into
focus
is
absolutely
right
That
s
definitely
the
vibe
we
were
going
for
in
working
on
the
story
from
a
structural
standpoint
building
tension
doing
some
jump
cuts
We
wanted
it
to
feel
like
the
reader
would
start
to
see
things
clearly
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
subjects
in
the
story
are
starting
to
see
things
clearly
And
then
some
of
them
never
did
Matthew
Muller
who
is
now
convicted
of
this
crime
doesn
t
necessarily
see
it
yet
Maybe
he
never
will
because
of
the
mental
illness
that
he
s
afflicted
with
But
then
there
are
some
other
really
interesting
questions
that
she
gets
into
at
the
end
about
how
there
are
other
people
affected
by
the
events
who
still
have
questions
about
what
did
or
didn
t
happen
Even
when
things
might
seem
settled
to
some
parties
involved
in
a
situation
to
others
reality
can
still
feel
somewhat
out
of
reach
I
don
t
know
if
the
Polaroid
is
quite
in
focus
for
everyone
involved
Something
I
ve
noticed
over
the
course
of
several
Atavist
stories
is
that
the
first
two-thirds
or
three-quarters
is
often
if
not
exclusively
third-person
and
then
in
that
final
chapter
or
the
final
quarter
or
maybe
even
just
an
epilogue
we
see
the
reporter
come
in
What
is
it
about
that
particular
structuring
that
appeals
to
you
I
d
never
thought
of
it
as
a
pattern
but
I
guess
it
is
to
a
certain
extent
and
on
maybe
a
certain
type
of
story
When
you
re
talking
about
the
types
of
stories
we
do
that
introduce
a
lot
of
these
gigantic
questions
and
when
you
get
to
the
end
there
s
a
bit
of
a
what
does
it
all
mean
and
I
think
sometimes
the
reporter
can
be
a
helpful
prism
for
starting
to
tie
some
of
those
things
together
I
d
like
to
think
that
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
last
passage
of
a
piece
our
writers
have
really
earned
the
trust
of
readers
So
when
they
do
become
the
prism
for
thinking
about
the
story
in
its
totality
the
reader
almost
feels
like
Oh
good
okay
now
they
re
here
It
definitely
doesn
t
work
in
every
story
And
I
wouldn
t
ever
want
to
put
it
in
every
story
But
I
do
feel
like
there
are
stories
where
I
want
to
know
what
the
reporter
thinks
I
want
to
see
the
reporter
in
this
case
talk
to
Mathew
Muller
over
the
course
of
four
years
I
don
t
think
it
s
a
conscious
decision
where
we
sit
down
and
say
Is
this
the
kind
of
piece
where
at
the
end
we
re
gon
na
go
in
the
first
person
And
certainly
there
are
stories
where
there
s
some
first
person
throughout
and
there
are
other
stories
where
some
first
person
comes
in
you
know
much
earlier
But
some
of
these
pieces
that
feel
like
they
have
lingering
loose
threads
sometimes
having
the
writer
there
to
navigate
that
can
be
a
good
way
to
wrap
things
up
I
liken
it
to
a
whodunit
And
at
the
very
end
Hercule
Poirot
is
going
to
come
in
he
s
going
to
sum
everything
up
he
s
going
to
answer
some
questions
It
s
relieving
some
of
the
pressure
it
s
bringing
some
new
light
it
almost
grounds
it
Like
I
feel
like
my
feet
are
back
on
the
ground
when
the
reporter
comes
in
to
show
the
work
and
show
some
interaction
and
raise
some
questions
that
sometimes
we
don
t
even
know
the
answers
to
Obviously
there
are
still
people
who
say
don
t
bring
yourself
as
a
journalist
into
magazine
reporting
unless
it
s
a
first-person
story
of
some
kind
I
just
feel
like
when
you
re
talking
about
these
really
rangy
pieces
you
want
it
to
feel
grounded
in
the
end
It
s
something
that
you
get
more
of
in
podcasting
because
obviously
you
re
hearing
the
host
you
much
more
feel
like
you
re
in
some
kind
of
relationship
You
re
letting
them
into
your
head
and
the
reporter
becomes
a
way
for
listeners
to
have
access
to
certain
questions
or
certain
issues
or
whatever
it
may
be
And
as
far
as
I
m
concerned
it
can
work
in
writing
as
well
at
least
it
doesn
t
just
have
to
be
audio-driven
I
hate
the
first-person
stuff
where
it
ll
start
off
like
Matthew
McConaughey
was
eating
steak
tartare
and
I
walked
up
to
him
But
we
don
t
have
to
worry
about
that
with
the
Atavist
stuff
because
you
guys
handle
it
so
well
Although
now
I
feel
like
I
m
just
gon
na
do
that
at
some
point
just
to
make
you
angry
So
I
m
working
on
an
essay
about
the
pros
and
cons
of
voice
recorders
and
tape
recorders
John
McPhee
never
uses
them
at
all
he
thinks
that
even
though
they
capture
everything
they
re
not
selective
And
he
trusts
that
when
he
s
taking
notes
he
s
getting
the
best
stuff
But
at
the
same
time
sometimes
your
penmanship
can
fail
you
And
by
not
capturing
everything
you
re
not
getting
the
exact
thing
down
It
s
a
conundrum
But
I
m
very
romantically
tied
to
the
idea
of
like
just
pencil
and
notebook
How
do
you
feel
about
it
Katia
Savchuk
Yeah
I
don
t
think
I
could
operate
like
that
because
I
d
be
too
focused
on
what
am
I
missing
Get
that
down
Remember
that
I
d
like
to
know
that
there
s
a
machine
going
in
the
background
Sometimes
you
don
t
know
what
s
going
to
be
important
until
later
Also
when
you
interview
other
people
you
learn
other
things
and
you
connect
dots
that
you
wouldn
t
have
otherwise
So
I
always
record
and
take
notes
I
m
taking
notes
on
the
ambient
details
what
someone
s
expression
looks
like
what
s
on
the
wall
those
kinds
of
things
I
trust
the
machine
to
be
getting
down
the
exact
quotes
A
long
time
ago
I
was
using
a
recorder
and
talking
to
a
horse
trainer
In
the
background
you
could
hear
blue
jays
chirping
and
that
ended
up
being
a
little
detail
I
was
able
to
fold
in
to
the
particular
chapter
I
was
writing
It
just
added
that
extra
layer
of
flavor
that
I
wouldn
t
have
been
able
to
get
if
I
was
just
scribbling
like
crazy
trying
to
keep
up
with
what
he
was
saying
I
mean
there
s
obviously
so
much
to
be
said
for
interviewing
in
person
The
trust
that
s
built
the
things
you
notice
But
there
s
also
something
I
enjoy
about
doing
interviews
over
the
phone
because
I
usually
try
to
type
in
real
time
First
of
all
it
kind
of
saves
you
time
I
have
an
in-ear
Olympus
ear
bud
recorder
and
I
m
also
typing
at
the
same
time
in
this
tool
called
Pear
Note
Then
once
I
m
done
recording
I
can
import
the
audio
and
I
link
them
So
then
you
can
press
play
in
Pear
Note
and
you
hear
that
part
of
the
tape
So
that
really
helped
with
fact-checking
the
story
I
know
Top
Chef
has
been
on
for
like
19
seasons
but
my
wife
and
I
just
discovered
it
On
the
latest
episode
one
of
the
judges
said
your
plate
has
to
have
like
authorship
and
another
said
you
have
to
edit
your
plate
And
I
was
like
oh
cooking
and
writing
are
coming
together
You
have
to
have
that
voice
and
how
you
have
to
think
about
what
to
leave
in
and
what
to
leave
out
Maybe
it
s
not
cooking
but
are
there
any
other
artistic
media
that
really
help
you
become
a
better
writer
I
do
love
dancing
as
a
hobby
and
not
in
any
way
professionally
But
it
s
something
I
ve
been
doing
for
a
long
time
just
for
fun
And
there
are
lots
of
elements
especially
for
people
who
take
it
seriously
it
s
practicing
it
s
getting
better
over
time
Like
the
Ira
Glass
quote
If
you
have
good
taste
you
won
t
be
meeting
your
own
standards
early
on
You
really
just
have
to
plow
through
that
and
get
a
little
bit
closer
and
a
little
bit
closer
But
what
I
ve
been
thinking
about
lately
is
the
sense
of
play
that
I
get
from
dancing
Like
I
approach
it
from
a
total
place
of
this
is
just
for
fun
to
unwind
I
don
t
have
anything
wrapped
up
in
it
around
I
want
to
be
the
best
I
want
this
dance
to
be
perfect
There
s
nothing
like
that
So
I
ve
been
trying
to
see
ways
that
I
can
bring
some
more
of
that
sense
of
play
into
work
A
lot
of
the
work
is
really
serious
and
important
and
depending
on
the
story
you
re
writing
about
real
people
and
their
lives
But
whether
it
s
at
the
sentence
level
or
free
writing
or
feeling
a
sense
of
play
when
you
re
coming
up
with
ideas
that
s
something
I
m
working
on
When
we
were
kids
even
in
middle
or
high
school
when
you
were
told
to
write
a
story
you
just
wanted
to
have
fun
with
it
and
write
the
thing
and
you
didn
t
care
if
it
sucked
or
won
an
award
or
all
these
things
that
we
attach
our
prestige
and
status
to
and
you
just
did
it
because
it
was
a
fun
creative
outlet
We
often
get
so
earnest
with
our
writing
and
our
work
We
just
attach
too
much
doom
and
gloom
to
it
you
know
the
tortured
writer
so
it
s
great
to
hear
you
talk
about
play
I
love
that
And
I
was
one
of
those
people
who
started
on
the
middle
school
newspaper
and
all
through
high
school
So
I
definitely
try
to
tap
in
as
much
as
I
can
to
that
spirit
On
your
website
you
write
that
you
re
a
proud
generalist
often
drawn
to
stories
about
inequality
psychology
wrongdoing
and
mysteries
of
all
kinds
How
did
you
arrive
at
that
in
your
journalism
I
added
that
line
not
too
long
ago
actually
I
hear
so
much
about
you
need
a
niche
And
it
certainly
can
be
helpful
but
it
s
just
something
that
doesn
t
work
for
me
One
thing
I
love
about
being
a
journalist
and
especially
a
freelancer
is
getting
to
follow
your
curiosity
and
learn
about
so
many
different
things
I
used
to
work
at
Forbes
magazine
for
the
wealth
team
There
s
a
lot
that
falls
under
that
as
it
s
probably
the
broadest
team
but
as
you
move
up
it
tends
to
get
more
and
more
specialized
and
that
just
wasn
t
what
I
wanted
to
do
But
I
did
sort
of
try
to
think
about
what
are
the
themes
in
my
work
What
am
I
generally
drawn
to
I
love
investigative
stories
and
have
a
bit
of
background
in
investigative
reporting
and
always
drawn
to
public
interest
issues
But
I
also
have
this
love
of
mystery
You
worked
as
a
private
investigator
too
In
what
way
has
that
helped
you
as
a
reporter
It
was
probably
a
lot
less
exciting
than
it
sounds
I
wasn
t
tailing
people
on
the
street
looking
for
cheating
husbands
or
anything
It
was
a
private
investigative
firm
and
a
lot
of
what
they
did
was
background
checks
and
investigations
that
are
part
of
lawsuits
They
did
do
exciting
work
but
a
lot
of
it
had
to
do
with
databases
and
knowing
how
to
use
those
to
find
information
I
loved
working
there
It
was
some
of
the
smartest
people
I
ve
ever
worked
with
and
I
loved
doing
investigative
work
It
was
just
that
the
end
product
would
be
this
memo
that
would
go
to
whoever
commissioned
it
at
the
law
firm
or
the
partners
at
some
hedge
fund
or
something
and
then
it
d
be
like
this
great
story
[
that
]
nobody
would
really
see
So
I
just
really
wanted
someone
to
read
it
and
that
creative
aspect
was
equally
important
to
me
I
do
wish
I
still
had
all
those
databases
but
they
re
expensive
And
you
know
you
have
to
be
licensed
In
the
Venn
diagram
of
all
those
things
that
you
re
interested
in
this
Atavist
piece
kind
of
encapsulates
a
whole
lot
wrongdoing
psychology
inequality
mystery
it
s
right
there
How
did
you
arrive
at
this
story
It
was
pretty
mainstream
at
the
time
but
then
stuck
with
it
and
told
something
that
is
wholly
and
uniquely
you
I
found
out
about
it
in
the
news
like
everybody
else
It
was
in
the
news
in
2015
obviously
because
the
police
initially
called
the
main
crime
I
write
about
a
hoax
The
word
that
everybody
uses
is
bizarre
which
it
certainly
was
so
it
caught
my
eye
but
I
was
working
at
Forbes
at
the
time
and
it
wasn
t
something
that
would
fall
into
their
coverage
area
Not
too
long
after
I
went
freelance
in
2017
the
victims
sued
the
city
of
Vallejo
California
and
ended
up
winning
a
settlement
and
so
it
was
back
in
the
headlines
I
was
like
oh
yeah
that
story
is
just
fascinating
somebody
must
have
already
written
the
magazine
version
of
it
And
I
looked
and
they
hadn
t
I
thought
somebody
must
be
currently
writing
a
magazine
version
of
it
but
why
don
t
I
just
give
it
a
shot
So
I
reached
out
to
a
lot
of
the
people
involved
and
then
went
from
there
It
s
funny
hearing
you
say
that
because
sometimes
I
come
up
with
ideas
and
think
This
is
great
but
if
I
came
up
with
it
someone
else
must
have
by
now
and
it
s
not
even
worth
pursuing
And
so
much
of
the
time
it
turns
out
to
be
true
There
are
things
that
are
in
the
zeitgeist
and
people
who
are
magazine
writers
see
all
the
elements
But
sometimes
it
s
the
ones
that
are
in
plain
sight
[
that
work
out
]
I
m
sure
a
lot
of
people
did
reach
out
to
them
but
they
probably
couldn
t
get
access
right
away
Nobody
wanted
to
talk
in
the
early
days
A
few
years
after
the
main
events
since
the
initial
media
circus
they
were
maybe
a
little
bit
more
receptive
Access
is
such
a
tricky
thing
of
course
to
tell
these
kinds
of
stories
and
in
getting
that
kind
of
trust
And
sometimes
just
getting
that
first
cold
email
the
first
cold
call
to
land
because
that
s
the
one
that
can
start
the
momentum
What
becomes
that
first
lead
domino
as
you
re
trying
to
build
sources
for
a
story
this
ambitious
The
first
thing
I
did
was
to
reach
out
to
the
victims
in
the
main
case
that
I
m
writing
about
Denise
Huskins
and
Aaron
Quinn
This
story
is
in
the
Bay
Area
which
is
where
I
live
so
I
figured
out
that
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
criminal
defense
attorney
has
come
across
their
criminal
defense
attorney
so
maybe
we
can
talk
about
why
they
had
one
which
is
obviously
because
they
weren
t
initially
believed
So
I
wrote
to
her
and
she
was
willing
to
pass
on
my
email
to
their
attorney
who
was
willing
to
pass
on
my
email
to
them
So
we
ended
up
corresponding
a
little
bit
and
then
meeting
in
person
just
to
kind
of
feel
each
other
out
Sometimes
I
like
to
say
let
s
meet
with
no
commitments
so
they
don
t
feel
like
they
re
signing
on
to
anything
But
this
was
obviously
a
very
traumatic
and
personal
story
for
them
And
a
lot
of
people
had
reached
out
to
them
So
they
wanted
to
see
you
know
do
they
feel
comfortable
and
trust
me
and
so
I
drove
to
where
they
live
And
we
had
a
great
conversation
But
then
the
next
day
they
said
actually
we
re
signing
a
book
deal
with
an
NDA
so
we
won
t
be
talking
to
you
The
book
ended
up
coming
out
which
was
essentially
an
extended
interview
it
was
really
their
story
in
their
voice
And
then
later
I
ended
up
interviewing
them
as
well
They
also
gave
extended
testimony
in
court
about
what
happened
to
them
In
terms
of
the
man
who
was
convicted
of
the
crime
there
was
one
family
friend
who
was
quoted
in
all
the
news
stories
and
I
found
him
on
Facebook
I
think
and
I
reached
out
to
him
because
he
was
kind
of
acting
as
a
spokesperson
for
the
family
I
just
said
something
along
the
lines
of
a
lot
of
people
are
probably
reaching
out
to
you
and
I
gave
my
impression
of
what
the
coverage
had
been
so
far
And
in
this
case
it
really
did
seem
one-dimensional
in
terms
of
the
man
involved
who
is
the
ex-Marine
Harvard-trained
lawyer
who
did
pro
bono
work
for
most
of
his
life
and
then
ended
up
being
convicted
of
these
pretty
bizarre
crimes
Some
of
the
news
articles
had
mentioned
almost
in
passing
that
he
has
bipolar
disorder
he
struggles
with
mental
illness
but
it
was
just
kind
of
a
throwaway
thing
and
it
didn
t
really
come
up
in
his
court
case
either
And
it
s
a
federal
court
case
That
s
not
to
excuse
anything
that
he
did
but
everyone
is
three-dimensional
how
does
somebody
go
from
A
to
B
What
role
did
mental
illness
play
How
was
that
for
his
family
to
watch
and
be
part
of
So
I
reached
out
to
them
and
told
them
that
my
intention
was
really
to
go
deeper
than
any
of
the
headlines
had
done
not
to
do
anything
sensational
but
really
try
to
understand
his
life
as
a
whole
and
write
a
more
nuanced
thorough
piece
and
that
I
was
willing
to
put
in
the
time
to
do
it
and
find
a
publication
that
would
edit
it
with
that
perspective
as
well
How
did
you
develop
that
degree
of
empathy
to
bring
that
to
your
reporting
so
you
can
get
to
that
nuance
and
beyond
the
headlines
I
don
t
know
if
you
develop
empathy
I
mean
I
think
to
be
a
magazine
writer
you
have
to
have
empathy
You
spend
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
get
inside
a
person
s
mind
in
a
way
If
it
s
a
case
of
wrongdoing
then
you
have
empathy
for
the
people
that
are
the
victims
of
whatever
it
is
But
usually
there
s
no
100
%
clear
victims
and
villains
In
this
case
and
again
not
to
excuse
what
he
did
but
Mathew
Muller
himself
said
if
I
m
dangerous
I
should
be
behind
bars
But
in
many
ways
he
was
also
a
victim
of
psychosis
and
certain
systems
that
told
him
that
it
wasn
t
okay
to
reveal
that
Like
the
military
like
the
legal
profession
or
a
father
who
was
kind
of
a
coach-type
figure
with
a
tough-it-out
mentality
These
were
all
reasons
he
didn
t
want
to
speak
out
when
he
started
running
into
troubles
with
delusion
That
s
why
I
love
magazine
writing
It
lets
you
give
all
the
context
and
the
nuance
that
really
is
there
whenever
humans
are
involved
Do
you
find
a
way
to
integrate
some
sort
of
a
pressure
valve
into
your
reporting
given
how
deep
you
can
go
with
people
talking
about
sometimes
very
disturbing
dramatic
things
So
you
don
t
take
on
too
much
of
what
you
re
reporting
on
I
think
there
are
so
many
other
people
out
there
doing
work
that
is
so
much
more
dramatic
the
people
on
the
frontline
in
Ukraine
right
now
certainly
In
this
particular
case
a
lot
of
the
interviews
were
pretty
spread
out
Some
of
the
interviews
were
pretty
intensive
like
five
hours
long
at
a
time
but
they
were
spread
out
over
time
And
with
Matt
Muller
we
did
a
lot
of
our
interviews
over
video
conference
in
the
jail
they
don
t
allow
in-person
visitors
in
the
jail
even
for
family
which
is
kind
of
crazy
that
somebody
wouldn
t
see
another
living
person
But
they
were
limited
to
half
an
hour
at
a
time
in
those
in
those
interviews
So
it
was
pretty
broken
up
I
don
t
think
I
have
any
revolutionary
coping
mechanisms
Dance
helps
taking
a
walk
I
have
an
accountability
buddy
Jaeah
Lee
another
freelancer
here
in
the
Bay
Area
who
is
an
amazing
reporter
and
writer
and
we
check
in
weekly
and
we
ve
done
that
pretty
much
for
the
last
four
years
I
think
that
really
helps
it
s
like
having
a
colleague
a
sort
of
home
base
that
you
can
run
things
by
wins
challenges
just
bounce
anything
off
of
The
story
is
practically
20,000
words
As
a
writer
it
s
a
lot
to
get
your
head
around
How
did
you
go
about
organizing
your
reporting
material
so
that
you
had
access
to
the
things
that
you
wanted
to
draw
from
I
definitely
don
t
think
I
could
write
a
long
piece
without
Scrivener
at
this
point
What
I
usually
do
and
did
in
this
case
is
just
tried
to
put
everything
in
there
I
tried
to
map
out
what
the
sections
were
going
to
be
and
I
created
a
folder
there
for
each
section
and
tried
to
put
everything
I
had
in
that
folder
photos
interview
transcripts
court
records
In
Scrivener
you
can
do
a
split
screen
So
I
would
then
have
that
folder
open
and
whatever
document
I
was
looking
at
in
the
bottom
and
I
would
have
the
writing
window
at
the
top
That
s
usually
how
I
organize
things
I
m
naturally
a
disorganized
person
And
I
like
to
think
I
m
not
alone
in
that
I
ve
got
things
for
a
big
project
and
I
ve
got
it
by
year
in
folders
So
at
least
it
s
organized
like
that
But
I
m
sure
that
within
that
year
it
s
going
to
have
to
be
further
subdivided
So
I
m
always
curious
how
people
do
that
because
it
can
get
unwieldy
and
out
of
hand
and
then
like
this
Google
Drive
has
some
things
saved
here
but
then
this
one
over
here
has
some
other
things
I
mean
it
s
still
a
perennial
challenge
I
think
to
an
extent
I
was
organized
but
at
the
same
time
I
always
think
that
I
m
gon
na
write
down
as
I
m
writing
which
page
of
which
court
record
I
got
this
fact
so
that
when
fact-checking
comes
along
I
just
know
exactly
where
it
is
But
I
just
have
still
never
managed
to
do
that
you
know
because
when
you
re
writing
you
don
t
want
to
note
down
the
exact
page
number
always
Oh
I
ll
remember
to
do
it
I
ll
make
a
little
note
And
then
you
never
do
Yeah
But
I
will
say
another
thing
that
was
really
helpful
especially
in
this
story
was
having
a
timeline
in
a
spreadsheet
format
You
have
the
years
and
the
months
and
then
I
had
different
columns
for
the
different
characters
or
threads
that
I
was
following
So
there
s
one
for
Matt
Muller
s
world
the
world
of
Denise
and
Aaron
or
the
world
of
the
crime
and
the
investigation
and
putting
the
key
events
there
really
helps
Sometimes
you
draw
connections
that
way
oh
this
actually
just
happened
the
same
month
as
this
happened
so
it
helps
with
structuring
things
and
seeing
the
patterns
that
might
not
be
apparent
Speaking
of
structure
given
how
big
the
piece
is
it
s
always
a
challenge
to
have
the
requisite
tension
to
keep
people
reading
What
was
the
challenge
in
getting
your
head
around
the
structure
and
making
sure
that
requisite
tension
and
pacing
was
there
and
satisfying
I
give
a
lot
of
credit
to
Seyward
for
that
and
working
on
the
structure
with
me
Initially
it
seemed
like
the
structure
I
started
with
was
going
to
work
It
seemed
to
make
sense
to
start
with
the
main
crime
which
is
this
bizarre
kidnapping
that
happened
on
Mare
Island
in
Vallejo
in
2015
There
were
wetsuits
lasers
pre-recorded
messages
NyQuil
blood
pressure
cuffs
I
mean
there
s
a
lot
of
bizarre
details
which
you
could
read
about
in
the
story
but
it
just
seemed
to
make
sense
to
start
there
because
it
s
so
gripping
But
once
you
looked
at
the
story
as
a
whole
starting
there
ended
up
taking
some
of
the
air
out
of
it
If
you
build
to
that
crime
you
know
in
advance
what
s
going
to
happen
you
know
that
Matt
s
responsible
and
this
was
never
going
to
be
a
whodunit
A
lot
of
the
story
is
also
about
Matt
How
did
he
go
from
this
sort
of
model
citizen
for
lack
of
a
better
word
to
this
convicted
criminal
and
why
did
he
do
what
he
did
So
what
we
ended
up
doing
was
starting
with
this
raid
on
a
cabin
in
South
Lake
Tahoe
where
he
s
arrested
And
we
describe
a
crime
there
but
it
s
actually
not
that
crime
It
s
a
different
crime
We
see
the
cabin
and
we
see
all
these
bizarre
things
in
the
cabin
It
s
super-cluttered
like
a
hoarder
s
home
hair
dye
and
stun
gun
and
a
bunch
of
gloves
and
electronics
spray
paints
youcrime
scene
tape
a
penis
pump
You
re
like
what
happened
here
And
that
drives
the
mystery
a
little
bit
We
learn
that
he
s
arrested
And
then
we
re
like
Well
who
is
this
guy
And
how
did
he
get
there
But
also
near
the
end
of
the
first
section
a
detective
discovers
this
long
blonde
hair
And
none
of
the
victims
in
the
crime
that
we
just
learned
about
was
blonde
and
the
suspect
isn
t
blonde
So
then
we
hope
that
what
drives
a
good
portion
of
this
story
is
Whose
hair
is
that
And
then
the
tension
that
drives
another
good
portion
of
the
story
is
Was
this
crime
a
hoax
or
not
What
were
some
challenges
that
you
experienced
as
you
were
synthesizing
the
piece
There
were
quite
a
few
challenges
along
the
way
One
of
them
was
Matt
s
mental
state
As
I
mentioned
delusion
played
a
big
part
in
his
life
and
in
the
course
of
interviewing
him
when
we
first
got
in
touch
in
2018
he
was
in
a
federal
prison
and
then
he
got
moved
to
a
jail
here
in
Solano
County
his
mental
health
kind
of
fluctuated
So
trying
to
figure
out
is
he
or
is
he
not
in
a
state
of
mind
where
I
can
trust
what
he
s
saying
Does
he
trust
me
He
kept
pulling
out
because
paranoia
got
the
better
of
him
He
told
me
just
last
month
which
I
didn
t
know
before
that
he
thought
I
was
a
CIA
agent
Then
at
one
point
he
ended
up
being
deemed
incompetent
to
stand
trial
and
the
judge
ordered
that
he
should
get
anti-psychotic
medication
against
his
will
But
he
was
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
and
it
wasn
t
clear
when
or
if
he
would
be
restored
to
legal
competency
and
I
really
wasn
t
sure
how
we
were
going
to
fact-check
with
him
If
he
s
deemed
incompetent
to
stand
trial
it
really
doesn
t
feel
ethical
to
reach
out
to
him
because
he
might
say
something
that
he
wouldn
t
say
if
he
was
mentally
stable
and
it
might
be
incriminating
So
if
he
s
not
legally
competent
it
doesn
t
feel
like
he
would
be
competent
to
you
know
participate
in
an
interview
He
did
end
up
being
restored
to
legal
competency
and
we
did
fact-check
with
him
But
that
was
a
situation
I
had
never
encountered
before
The
piece
is
intense
Yeah
There
are
a
lot
of
twists
there
If
you
were
writing
it
as
a
novel
you
d
be
like
well
that
s
a
that
s
a
little
bit
too
convenient
For
example
the
lead
investigator
having
had
a
relationship
with
the
intended
target
of
the
kidnapping
who
is
also
the
ex-fiancée
of
the
victim
I
mean
it
s
very
odd
If
you
were
writing
a
novel
you
d
be
like
this
is
lazy
There
s
just
a
lot
of
things
that
feel
like
a
movie
which
is
the
theme
that
kept
coming
up
over
and
over
and
over
in
the
story
people
thinking
that
life
is
like
the
movies
and
then
realizing
that
it
s
not
At
the
end
of
these
conversations
I
typically
like
to
ask
guests
for
a
recommendation
of
some
kind
that
can
be
anything
from
something
professional
to
a
comfy
pair
of
socks
you
re
really
excited
about
Fanny
packs
Who
knows
So
what
would
you
recommend
for
the
listeners
out
there
I
would
recommend
a
practice
that
I
started
doing
this
year
that
I
always
meant
to
do
but
never
did
before
which
is
to
copy
the
work
of
your
idols
It
s
something
you
always
hear
about
like
Joan
Didion
did
that
artists
in
training
go
to
the
museum
and
copy
the
works
of
the
greats
So
it
s
something
that
I
always
thought
was
intriguing
But
I
actually
tried
it
this
year
And
I
started
with
David
Grann
s
work
who
is
one
of
my
heroes
He
has
written
a
lot
of
things
in
the
true
crime
genre
so
I
thought
it
was
a
good
one
I
ended
up
copying
his
stories
just
retyping
them
for
10
minutes
before
I
started
writing
for
the
day
And
I
found
it
to
be
an
amazing
practice
I
mean
first
of
all
it
like
gets
your
hands
just
flowing
like
the
words
flowing
instead
of
just
sitting
down
with
your
own
text
like
a
blank
page
It
s
almost
like
running
a
few
laps
to
give
your
fingers
something
to
do
Also
I
feel
like
you
pick
up
things
that
you
don
t
from
reading
alone
the
sort
of
decisions
on
a
sentence
level
that
a
writer
makes
I
found
it
to
be
really
inspiring
and
educational
and
also
kind
of
fun

In

thought-provoking
essay
published
in
January
Astra
and
Sunaura
Taylor
make
a
socialist
feminist
case
for
veganism
which
can
open
outward
into
other
calls
for
liberation
and
help
us
understand
and
be
part
of
the
paradigm
shift
that
needs
to
happen
to
create
a
more
egalitarian
and
sustainable
society
Capitalism
is
about
controlling
bodies
they
write
not
just
of
humans
but
of
nonhuman
animals
like
cows
and
pigs
While
the
trauma
inflicted
on
people
and
animals
…
isn
t
the
same
it
is
interconnected
We
are
all
caught
in
the
same
racist
sexist
colonial
and
ecologically
catastrophic
capitalist
system
This
is
a
call
for
cross-species
solidarity
and
to
consider
veganism
alongside
other
social
justice
movements
on
the
left
It
s
a
tough
read
particularly
for
people
who
consider
themselves
socialists
feminists
or
animal
advocates
and
continue
to
consume
meat
and
dairy
products
but
an
important

He
freely
admits
For
me
more
than

any

the
Cheese
Boutique
delivers
a
blissful
calming
dose
of
retail
therapy
However
his
bias
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
a
lovely
narrative
The
owners
the
Pristines
were
originally
immigrants
from
Kosovo
who
managed
to
make
a
home
on
a
once
lonely
ungainly
street
that
now
attracts
hordes
of
Land
Rovers
on
the
weekend
their
drivers
desperate
for
a
cheese
fix
It
s
a
joyful
success
story
of
a
business
that
thrived
even
during
the
pandemic
by
starting
virtual
cheese-making
classes
and
adding
a
food
truck
yet
kept
its
family
roots
Even
though
the
shop
attracts
fancy
customers
Dustin
Hoffman
is
a
visitor
and
fancy
prices
two
generations
of
Pristines
are
still
there
seven
days
a
week
to
run
it
Come
for
the
family
story
and
stay
for
the
luscious
cheese
descriptions
You
let
it
come
to
room
temp
slice
off
the
top
rind
and
spoon
out
the
gooey
inside
called
the
paste
The
odor
is
nauseating—reminiscent
of
rot
and
ancient
back
alleys—but
to
the
tastebuds
it

Just
after
seven
in

morning
on
June

2015
Misty
Carausu
joined
a
group
of
police
officers
lining
up
outside
a
dark
green
cabin
with
white
trim
The
blinds
inside
were
drawn
Jeffrey
pines
cast
thick
shadows
across
the
driveway
The
air
was
still
but
for
the
scrape
of
boots
on
asphalt
and
the
occasional
call
of
a
bird
Carausu
35
was
at
least
a
head
shorter
than
the
other
officers
and
the
only
woman
She
wore
iridescent
eye
shadow
and
pearl
earrings
along
with
a
tactical
vest
As
she
gripped
her
gun
she
felt
as
if
she
d
stepped
into
one
of
the
true-crime
documentaries
she
binge-watched
at
night
It
was
Carausu
s
first
day
as
a
detective
En
route
to
the
scene
she
d
been
filled
in
on
the
case
Around
3:30
a.
m
the
previous
Friday
a
52-year-old
nurse
named
Lynn
Yen
who
lived
at
the
edge
of
Dublin
the
suburb
east
of
San
Francisco
where
Carausu
worked
had
called
911
Minutes
earlier
Lynn
and
her
60-year-old
husband
Chung
woke
to
a
flashlight
and
a
laser
shining
in
their
faces
A
masked
man
dressed
in
black
stood
at
the
foot
of
their
bed
We
have
your
daughter
and
she
s
safe
the
man
said
Kelly
22
had
been
in
her
bedroom
across
the
hall
Using
what
Lynn
described
as
a
calm
soft
voice
the
intruder
told
the
couple
to
turn
over
and
put
their
hands
behind
their
backs
Then
he
announced
that
he
would
tie
them
up
When
Chung
felt
the
man
touch
him
he
took
a
swing
Lynn
grabbed
her
phone
from
the
nightstand
locked
herself
in
the
bathroom
and
called
for
help
She
told
the
dispatcher
that
she
heard
fighting
then
her
husband
yell
Honey
go
get
the
gun
even
though
they
didn
t
own
one
A
few
minutes
later
the
intruder
fled
downstairs
and
out
the
back
door
which
opened
onto
miles
of
rolling
hills
and
open
fields
When
officers
arrived
at
the
scene
Chung
had
bruises
on
his
arms
and
face
and
was
bleeding
from
a
cut
above
his
ear—he
said
the
intruder
had
hit
him
with
a
metal
flashlight
A
window
near
the
back
door
was
open
and
the
screen
had
been
removed
In
the
couple
s
bedroom
police
found
a
black
wool
glove
and
three
plastic
zip
ties
On
a
gravel
path
behind
the
house
near
a
cluster
of
foxtails
officers
recovered
another
zip
tie
and
a
six-inch
shred
of
black
duct
tape
Kelly
who
was
unharmed
handed
a
sergeant
something
she
d
found
on
a
hallway
cabinet
near
her
room
a
cell
phone
she
didn
t
recognize
Police
later
traced
the
phone
number
to
the
cabin
Carausu
and
her
colleagues
were
now
preparing
to
enter
It
sat
on
a
residential
street
in
South
Lake
Tahoe
a
ski
resort
town
130
miles
from
Dublin
As
the
raid
began
Carausu
heard
the
cabin
s
front
door
splinter
Officers
barked
Search
warrant
as
they
shoved
through
a
barricade
of
chairs
Carausu
maneuvered
around
clutter
on
the
living
room
floor
a
set
of
crutches
license
plates
clothing
electronics
a
massage
table
Empty
boxes
were
piled
against
a
window
open
bottles
of
wine
and
cans
of
spray
paint
littered
the
kitchen
counters
Carausu
s
job
was
to
process
evidence
She
snapped
photos
of
a
black
ski
mask
black
duct
tape
and
mismatched
black
gloves
A
stun
gun
sat
on
a
rocking
chair
In
a
banker
s
box
she
found
more
duct
tape
and
gloves
along
with
walkie-talkies
a
radar
detector
zip
ties
rope
and
a
device
for
making
keys
In
a
bathroom
were
makeup
brushes
and
a
partly
empty
bottle
of
NyQuil
An
open
tube
of
golden
brunette
hair
dye
lay
on
the
sink
near
a
disposable
glove
stained
with
the
dye
s
residue
In
one
bedroom
were
three
more
gloves
yellow
crime-scene
tape
and
on
the
bed
a
spiked
dog-training
collar
in
another
was
a
bottle
of
Vaseline
lotion
used
paper
towels
and
a
penis
pump
This
is
creepy
Carausu
recalled
thinking
as
she
stuffed
items
into
paper
bags
Something
crazy
happened
in
here
The
police
also
collected
flashlights
cell
phones
hard
drives
and
several
computers
including
an
Asus
laptop
that
had
been
stashed
under
a
mattress
Around
noon
Carausu
and
her
colleagues
drove
to
a
tow
yard
to
search
a
stolen
white
Mustang
recovered
near
the
cabin
Inside
they
found
items
they
thought
could
be
linked
to
the
Dublin
break-in
two
gloves
matching
one
from
the
crime
scene
both
covered
in
foxtails
receipts
for
a
flashlight
a
speaker
and
zip
ties
purchased
near
Dublin
the
night
of
the
home
invasion
burglary
tools
and
a
metal
flashlight
The
back
seat
of
the
Mustang
had
been
removed
Carausu
wondered
if
someone
had
made
room
for
a
large
object
such
as
a
body
Strangely
other
clues
didn
t
seem
connected
to
the
Dublin
crime
Among
the
recent
destinations
on
the
car
s
GPS
was
an
address
in
Huntington
Beach
400
miles
south
of
Lake
Tahoe
In
the
trunk
Carausu
saw
a
blood-pressure
cuff
a
camouflage
tarp
and
a
mesh
vest
with
a
wireless
speaker
in
one
of
the
pockets
She
also
found
a
BB
gun
a
dart
gun
and
a
Nerf
Super
Soaker
that
had
been
painted
black
with
a
flashlight
and
a
laser
pointer
taped
to
the
barrel
Stuffed
in
a
large
duffel
bag
was
a
blow-up
doll
in
black
clothing
rigged
with
wiring
so
that
it
could
be
made
to
sit
or
stand
The
bag
also
contained
a
military-style
pistol
belt
its
pouches
crammed
with
two
pairs
of
Speedo
swim
goggles
Carausu
pulled
one
of
them
out
Black
duct
tape
covered
the
lenses
Caught
in
the
tape
was
a
long
strand
of
blond
hair
None
of
the
victims
in
the
Dublin
home
invasion
were
blond
Neither
was
the
suspect
which
Carausu
knew
because
she
d
watched
officers
escort
him
out
of
the
cabin
in
handcuffs
He
didn
t
put
up
a
fight
when
they
burst
through
the
door
He
wandered
out
of
a
bedroom
and
obeyed
commands
to
lie
on
the
ground
In
his
late
thirties
tall
and
fit
the
man
wore
a
black
athletic
shirt
and
jeans
He
resembled
Charlie
Sheen
with
a
chiseled
jawline
and
tousled
dark
hair
Do
you
know
why
we
re
here
a
detective
asked
Yes
he
replied
The
suspect
said
nothing
else
as
officers
led
him
to
a
patrol
car
Before
they
loaded
him
inside
Carausu
told
the
man
to
look
at
her
camera
He
stared
intensely
into
the
lens
his
mouth
an
indecipherable
line
Carausu
read
his
name
on
pill
bottles
and
mail
scattered
around
the
stolen
Mustang
Matthew
Muller
Muller
grew
up
in
the
suburbs
of
Sacramento
where
homes
flew
American
flags
wild
turkeys
roamed
the
streets
and
fathers
took
their
sons
fishing
for
bass
in
Lake
Natoma
His
mother
Joyce
was
a
middle
school
English
teacher
and
his
father
Monty
was
a
school
administrator
and
wrestling
coach
The
family
spent
summers
hiking
in
the
Sierra
Nevada
abalone
diving
in
Bodega
Bay
or
relaxing
at
a
lakeside
cabin
in
Michigan
Each
Christmas
they
hosted
a
party
on
their
cul
de
sac
and
Monty
dressed
up
as
Santa
Muller
was
a
strong-willed
introverted
child
Despite
his
father
s
best
efforts
he
didn
t
take
to
wrestling
or
football
preferring
to
run
or
ski
or
walk
the
dog
alone
He
played
trumpet
in
the
school
band
and
devoured
dystopian
novels
by
George
Orwell
Aldous
Huxley
and
Yevgeny
Zamyatin
His
favorite
short
story
Ray
Bradbury
s
The
Veldt
was
about
two
children
who
project
their
fantasies
onto
the
walls
of
a
virtual
reality
nursery
until
make-believe
lions
come
to
life
and
eat
the
siblings
parents
Muller
had
a
core
group
of
friends
at
school
but
bullies
teased
him
about
being
overweight
Being
picked
on
fueled
his
instinct
to
stick
up
for
underdogs
an
impulse
he
sometimes
took
to
extremes
When
his
younger
brother
Kent
was
slow
to
talk
he
appointed
himself
spokesperson
to
a
degree
that
concerned
their
mom
He
s
never
going
to
have
a
vocabulary
if
you
keep
speaking
for
him
Joyce
recalled
thinking
Later
Muller
stuffed
gum
in
a
girl
s
trumpet
after
she
taunted
someone
at
a
music
competition
During
his
senior
year
of
high
school
Muller
learned
that
his
father
was
having
an
affair
Monty
moved
in
with
the
woman
he
was
seeing
and
he
and
Joyce
divorced
Muller
soon
decided
to
enlist
in
the
Marines
telling
Joyce
that
he
needed
discipline
and
wanted
to
get
in
shape
In
truth
he
worried
that
paying
for
college
would
strain
her
finances
Muller
was
a
round
peg
struggling
to
fit
into
a
square
hole
in
the
Marines
his
roommate
during
boot
camp
later
wrote
In
the
first
13
weeks
he
lost
more
than
50
pounds
He
didn
t
join
his
platoon
mates
on
weekend
outings
instead
squeezing
in
extra
workouts
For
a
time
he
subsisted
on
Powerade
and
garlic
rice
He
earned
the
nickname
Sergeant
Mulder
after
the
FBI
agent
on
The
X-Files
because
of
his
deadpan
demeanor
Muller
bristled
at
recruits
who
preyed
on
perceived
weakness
When
some
bullied
his
roommate
Muller
stood
up
for
him
Muller
spent
three
years
playing
trumpet
in
the
Marine
Corps
band
at
bases
in
California
and
Japan
where
he
also
started
a
nonprofit
to
teach
locals
about
the
Internet
In
1999
he
deployed
to
train
soldiers
in
the
Middle
East
He
earned
several
medals
and
a
promotion
before
being
honorably
discharged
Back
home
in
California
Muller
attended
Pomona
College
where
he
threw
himself
into
volunteer
work
which
included
helping
homeless
people
secure
government
benefits
and
running
an
outdoors
program
More
than
anyone
I
had
ever
met
he
strived
to
be
noble
to
be
kind
to
be
generous
his
friend
Eve
Florin
later
wrote
In
the
summer
of
2001
Muller
traveled
to
Prague
for
an
academic
program
There
he
met
a
driven
young
woman
from
Kyrgyzstan
with
a
slight
figure
and
long
dark
hair
They
fell
in
love
The
woman
declined
to
be
interviewed
At
her
request
The
Atavist
is
not
using
her
name
After
Muller
graduated
from
Pomona
they
exchanged
vows
under
an
arch
of
white
roses
on
the
sun-dappled
shores
of
Donner
Lake
about
15
miles
north
of
Lake
Tahoe
In
2003
the
couple
moved
to
Boston
where
he
started
at
Harvard
Law
School
and
she
attended
Boston
College
Muller
became
involved
with
Harvard
s
Legal
Aid
Bureau
where
he
represented
low-income
tenants
and
immigrants
who
were
victims
of
domestic
violence
On
one
occasion
a
client
s
husband
found
a
business
card
that
the
bureau
s
receptionist
had
given
her
and
beat
her
so
severely
that
her
jaw
had
to
be
wired
shut
Muller
blamed
himself
Their
crisis
felt
like
it
was
part
of
my
life
too
he
said
in
an
interview
After
earning
his
law
degree
Muller
stayed
at
Harvard
to
teach
and
work
in
the
Immigration
and
Refugee
Clinical
Program
Dressing
in
suits
for
class
he
came
across
as
very
formal
intense
and
guarded
but
also
extremely
knowledgeable
and
someone
who
truly
cared
about
the
cause
and
the
immigrant
community
a
former
student
of
his
recalled
Muller
earned
near
perfect
ratings
as
a
lecturer
and
worked
with
Deborah
Anker
a
leading
scholar
of
immigration
law
authoring
papers
and
Supreme
Court
briefs
When
Anker
went
on
sabbatical
she
tapped
him
to
head
the
clinical
program
He
was
warm
caring
earnest
smart
enthusiastic
engaging
thoughtful
Anker
recalled
He
was
a
super
good
human
being
Muller
was
unusually
devoted
to
his
clients
buying
one
a
wedding
gift
and
letting
another
stay
at
his
apartment
Even
when
he
won
a
case
he
couldn
t
shake
the
injustice
he
perceived
in
the
world
Part
of
me
would
be
really
sad
because
it
should
not
take
all
this
effort
just
to
make
something
the
way
it
should
ve
been
he
said
He
likened
the
feeling
to
going
into
a
room
and
needing
to
straighten
the
picture
set
it
right
For
the
program
s
anniversary
one
year
Muller
tracked
down
dozens
of
alumni
and
framed
their
messages
as
a
gift
to
Anker
His
own
note
read
Learning
from
you
has
been
and
I
think
always
will
be
the
highlight
of
my
legal
career
This
struck
Anker
as
odd
I
thought
he
was
going
to
be
a
leading
immigration
lawyer
in
America
she
said
This
is
not
the
height
of
your
career—this
is
the
beginning
Muller
scoured
the
room
for
anything
out
of
place
anything
that
could
be
a
bug
Over
and
over
he
searched
for
answers
among
the
snaking
wires
and
blinking
lights
It
came
as
a
shock
to
Muller
s
parents
when
in
the
summer
of
2008
he
revealed
that
he
had
bipolar
disorder
Mental
illness
ran
in
Monty
s
family
though
they
didn
t
speak
of
it
much
Muller
had
never
mentioned
any
mental
health
problems
to
his
parents
beyond
sometimes
feeling
blue
during
the
winter
months
and
neither
had
his
wife
In
fact
Muller
had
grappled
with
disturbing
thoughts
since
his
time
in
the
Marines
After
receiving
a
series
of
anthrax
vaccines
before
his
Middle
East
mission
he
struggled
to
get
out
of
bed
for
weeks
and
his
performance
on
fitness
tests
plummeted
He
later
attributed
his
symptoms
to
Gulf
War
syndrome
For
the
first
time
bleak
thoughts
took
up
residence
in
his
mind
You
re
not
good
enough
you
re
the
worst
person
in
the
world
He
d
been
considering
a
long
career
in
the
military
but
now
he
decided
to
request
a
discharge
In
college
Muller
fell
into
a
cycle
Every
summer
and
fall
he
was
productive
and
slept
little
every
winter
and
spring
he
labored
to
finish
assignments
and
his
mood
darkened
As
the
winter
chill
set
in
during
his
second
year
of
law
school
negative
thoughts
cut
particularly
deep
You
re
not
doing
enough
to
help
you
re
horrible
the
world
is
terrible
For
the
first
time
he
contemplated
suicide
Over
the
years
Muller
saw
several
psychiatrists
One
at
Harvard
diagnosed
him
with
major
depression
noting
that
he
also
showed
signs
of
mania
Muller
tried
medication
but
stopped
each
time
because
he
didn
t
like
the
side
effects
He
took
pains
to
hide
his
condition
from
his
parents
from
his
colleagues
and
as
much
as
possible
from
his
wife
who
moved
away
in
2005
to
attend
law
school
It
felt
like
a
weakness
something
I
shouldn
t
be
troubling
other
people
with
Muller
said
He
especially
didn
t
want
anyone
finding
out
about
the
time
a
delusion
took
hold
of
him
It
happened
while
he
was
working
at
Harvard
in
an
office
on
the
fourth
floor
of
Pound
Hall
a
concrete
building
at
the
edge
of
campus
He
began
to
suspect
that
the
government
was
tapping
his
phone
and
hacking
his
computer
Officials
were
after
him
he
decided
because
some
of
his
clients
had
been
accused
of
having
links
to
terrorists
Nothing
specific
triggered
his
paranoia—it
began
as
a
feeling
and
his
mind
filled
in
the
gaps
Muller
frantically
inspected
wall
conduits
that
held
bundles
of
telephone
wires
and
followed
their
trail
to
a
server
room
in
the
basement
Through
a
crack
between
two
doors
he
glimpsed
a
mess
of
equipment
He
scoured
the
room
for
anything
out
of
place
anything
that
could
be
a
bug
Over
and
over
he
searched
for
answers
among
the
snaking
wires
and
blinking
lights
Muller
hoped
that
escaping
New
England
s
winters
and
trading
asylum
law
for
the
tamer
world
of
patent
litigation
would
improve
his
mood
so
in
2009
he
and
his
wife
moved
to
Silicon
Valley
where
he
started
a
job
at
a
large
law
firm
But
instead
of
feeling
better
he
again
became
suicidal
He
agreed
to
get
help
and
a
psychiatrist
prescribed
Wellbutrin
The
antidepressant
quieted
Muller
s
suicidal
thoughts
and
kept
him
productive
at
his
new
job
but
it
also
prevented
him
from
sleeping
One
night
he
was
tossing
and
turning
on
the
couch
to
avoid
waking
his
wife
when
he
heard
a
distant
muffled
voice
Half
asleep
he
thought
the
TV
had
come
on
He
heard
voices
again
on
subsequent
nights
closer
and
clearer
this
time
At
first
he
told
himself
he
was
dreaming
but
eventually
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
voices
were
there
when
he
was
awake
They
were
androgynous
almost
robotic
They
didn
t
tell
him
what
to
do
instead
they
kept
up
a
running
commentary
mostly
about
his
faults
Muller
didn
t
tell
his
family
concerned
they
d
think
he
was
dangerous
crazy
Nor
did
he
inform
his
psychiatrist
fearing
it
would
end
up
in
his
bar
application
He
had
let
his
new
employer
assume
that
he
wasn
t
yet
licensed
to
practice
law
because
he
needed
to
retake
the
bar
exam
in
fact
he
had
passed
the
exam
but
not
yet
registered
with
the
California
bar
agonizing
over
what
to
write
about
his
mental
health
in
the
required
moral
character
section
of
the
paperwork
In
Muller
s
telling
to
quiet
the
voices
and
wear
himself
out
enough
to
sleep
he
went
on
long
walks
at
night
Often
he
hiked
to
the
Stanford
Dish
a
radio
telescope
along
a
popular
trail
near
the
Stanford
University
campus
Not
long
after
midnight
one
Friday
in
late
September
2009
he
was
returning
to
his
car
in
College
Terrace
a
residential
neighborhood
in
Palo
Alto
when
a
police
officer
stopped
him
and
asked
to
see
his
ID
According
to
Muller
when
the
officer
inquired
what
he
was
doing
there
so
late
he
said
that
he
was
visiting
a
friend—he
was
reluctant
to
admit
that
he
d
trespassed
on
a
trail
that
was
closed
after
dark
The
officer
reported
that
Muller
claimed
to
be
a
visiting
professor
at
Stanford
which
police
later
determined
was
false
Three
weeks
later
a
Palo
Alto
police
detective
came
to
Muller
s
apartment
and
left
a
business
card
with
his
wife
When
Muller
called
the
number
he
learned
that
police
wanted
to
question
him
about
an
attempted
sexual
assault
in
College
Terrace
His
name
had
come
up
in
recent
reports
of
suspicious
persons
in
the
area
He
told
the
detective
that
he
d
read
about
the
incident
in
the
local
paper
and
he
agreed
to
meet
According
to
Muller
before
he
could
make
it
to
the
station
two
detectives
showed
up
at
his
law
firm
to
question
him
The
encounter
set
him
on
edge
He
wondered
if
the
detectives
had
come
to
install
spy
equipment
in
his
office
Recalling
his
recent
asylum
cases
he
decided
that
they
were
conspiring
with
the
Chinese
government
The
Palo
Alto
Police
Department
declined
to
confirm
that
Muller
was
questioned
at
his
office
citing
an
open
investigation
Muller
already
had
suspicions
about
a
certain
Honda
Accord
often
parked
near
his
apartment
He
d
been
placing
pebbles
behind
the
wheels
to
check
whether
it
moved
and
varying
his
route
to
work
to
avoid
being
followed
Now
he
memorized
exit
routes
in
his
office
building
and
worked
with
the
blinds
shut
When
he
became
convinced
that
his
pursuers
were
using
a
laser
microphone
to
pick
up
sound
vibrations
in
his
office
he
decamped
to
the
firm
s
library
It
seemed
like
this
was
going
to
rapidly
escalate
They
were
trying
to
destroy
me
because
they
wanted
to
make
me
lose
my
job
isolate
me
make
me
lose
my
credibility
Muller
recalled
thinking
At
that
point
I
started
getting
afraid
for
my
family
He
felt
he
had
no
choice
but
to
flee
Muller
traded
his
car
which
he
assumed
was
bugged
for
his
mother
s
SUV
and
stocked
up
on
food
and
survival
gear
A
few
days
later
he
disappeared
The
day
after
the
South
Lake
Tahoe
raid
Misty
Carausu
arrived
at
her
new
office
on
the
second
floor
of
the
Dublin
Civic
Center
At
the
time
the
police
department
occupied
half
the
building
which
resembles
a
ring
cut
in
half
and
the
fragments
slid
apart
Carausu
sat
down
in
an
empty
gray
cubicle
in
a
room
with
drab
carpeting
She
hadn
t
yet
tacked
up
photos
of
her
teenage
son
whom
she
had
at
16
and
raised
on
her
own
Carausu
didn
t
plan
on
becoming
a
cop
Pretty
and
bubbly
with
manicured
nails
and
striking
hazel
eyes
she
was
in
her
mid-twenties
and
working
as
an
assistant
manager
at
a
Safeway
when
a
friend
s
husband
was
convicted
of
sexually
assaulting
a
mutual
friend
She
joined
the
force
hoping
to
find
justice
for
rape
victims
After
a
decade
as
a
deputy
Carausu
who
fostered
bunnies
sometimes
compared
herself
to
Judy
Hopps
the
idealistic
rabbit
who
works
as
a
cop
in
Disney
s
Zootopia
As
she
labeled
evidence
from
the
cabin
Carausu
couldn
t
get
the
blond
strand
of
hair
she
d
found
in
the
Mustang
out
of
her
mind
This
wasn
t
his
first
time
she
told
her
colleagues
We
re
going
to
solve
some
crimes
With
her
boss
s
support
Carausu
began
to
investigate
whether
they
d
stumbled
onto
something
larger
than
a
single
home
invasion
In
police
databases
Matthew
Muller
s
name
yielded
a
hit
for
an
unsolved
2009
break-in
near
Stanford
A
32-year-old
woman
was
sleeping
in
her
apartment
in
College
Terrace
when
a
strange
man
jumped
on
top
of
her
He
appeared
to
be
in
his
twenties
and
was
white
tall
and
lean
He
wore
a
mask
black
gloves
and
black
spandex-like
clothing
The
man
tied
her
hands
behind
her
back
bound
her
ankles
with
Velcro
straps
and
covered
her
eyes
with
tape
Then
he
gave
her
a
choice
drink
NyQuil
get
shocked
with
a
stun
gun
or
be
injected
with
what
he
called
A-bomb
When
she
opted
for
the
NyQuil
the
man
confirmed
with
her
that
she
wasn
t
allergic
to
any
of
its
ingredients
before
pouring
the
medicine
down
her
throat
The
intruder
gathered
personal
information
and
indicated
he
d
use
it
to
steal
her
money
At
times
the
victim
heard
the
man
whisper
to
someone
and
she
would
later
describe
seeing
a
silhouette
in
the
room
but
she
never
heard
a
second
voice
She
reported
that
the
man
tried
to
rape
her
and
she
fought
back
When
she
made
up
a
story
about
having
been
raped
in
high
school
he
stopped
saying
he
didn
t
want
to
victimize
her
again
Before
leaving
he
threatened
to
harm
her
family
if
she
called
911
and
mentioned
that
he
had
planted
evidence
to
mislead
authorities
Three
weeks
before
the
attack
Carausu
learned
a
police
officer
had
come
across
Muller
walking
late
at
night
in
the
vicinity
of
the
crime
Police
later
discovered
that
the
College
Terrace
victim
a
Stanford
student
had
attended
an
event
that
Muller
organized
at
Harvard
the
previous
year
Palo
Alto
detectives
identified
him
as
their
primary
suspect
But
DNA
recovered
at
the
crime
scene
wasn
t
a
match
Ultimately
law
enforcement
didn
t
find
enough
evidence
to
recommend
charging
Muller
Carausu
discovered
that
the
home
invasion
had
eerie
parallels
to
two
other
unsolved
crimes
in
Silicon
Valley
Less
than
a
month
before
the
College
Terrace
incident
a
27-year-old
woman
in
Mountain
View
woke
around
5
a.
m
to
find
a
man
on
top
of
her
He
appeared
to
be
white
and
slim
about
six
feet
tall
and
wore
tight
black
clothing
and
a
ski
mask
When
she
started
screaming
he
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
and
explained
that
he
was
part
of
a
group
of
criminals
that
planned
to
steal
her
identity
and
wire
money
abroad
The
man
bound
her
hands
and
ankles
then
placed
blacked-out
swim
goggles
over
her
eyes—she
felt
her
hair
catch
in
one
of
the
straps
He
made
her
drink
what
tasted
like
cough
syrup
before
collecting
personal
information
At
one
point
he
used
her
phone
to
send
a
message
to
her
boss
saying
that
she
was
sick
Periodically
the
woman
heard
him
talking
to
someone
but
she
never
heard
or
saw
anyone
else
Eventually
the
man
told
her
I
have
some
bad
news
I
m
going
to
have
to
rape
you
According
to
an
account
the
victim
later
shared
with
NBC
s
Dateline
she
begged
him
not
to
and
he
relented
I
can
t
do
this
he
muttered
I
m
sorry
about
this
Throughout
the
encounter
the
intruder
was
polite
the
victim
recalled
Before
leaving
he
advised
her
to
get
a
dog
for
protection
The
woman
told
Dateline
that
when
she
called
the
Mountain
View
police
they
initially
suggested
she
might
have
had
a
bad
dream
Ultimately
authorities
concluded
that
the
person
behind
the
attack
had
also
likely
committed
the
one
in
College
Terrace
In
a
statement
for
this
story
the
Mountain
View
police
said
We
continue
to
keep
this
investigation
open
and
have
been
and
are
treating
it
seriously
The
final
case
Carausu
learned
about
happened
three
years
after
the
other
two
in
November
2012
A
26-year-old
woman
who
lived
just
north
of
the
Stanford
campus
awoke
at
2:20
a.
m
to
see
a
masked
man
in
gloves
and
dark
clothing
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
He
held
her
down
but
she
screamed
and
fought
back
Eventually
he
fled
The
woman
later
noticed
that
her
computer
had
been
moved
and
found
two
bump
keys
which
open
any
lock
from
a
certain
manufacturer
near
the
front
door
In
neither
that
case
nor
the
one
in
Mountain
View
was
Muller
named
as
a
suspect
Carausu
stumbled
upon
an
additional
clue
when
she
called
the
owner
of
the
stolen
Mustang
police
had
recovered
in
South
Lake
Tahoe
He
turned
out
to
be
a
medical
student
who
lived
on
the
edge
of
Mare
Island
40
miles
northwest
of
Dublin
In
early
January
2015
he
had
returned
from
a
trip
to
find
that
someone
had
taken
his
car
keys
from
his
home
and
driven
his
Mustang
out
of
the
garage
When
Carausu
told
him
that
her
department
had
arrested
someone
for
a
home
invasion
near
where
his
car
was
found
he
asked
if
she
d
heard
of
the
Mare
Island
creeper
a
Peeping
Tom
Between
August
2014
and
January
2015
at
least
four
women
in
the
area
had
reported
seeing
a
man
peering
through
their
windows
or
climbing
on
their
roof
Two
had
just
taken
a
shower
when
they
spotted
him
One
saw
him
taking
pictures
while
another
saw
him
descending
a
ladder
Two
of
the
women
lived
on
the
same
street
Kirkland
Avenue
Some
of
the
women
described
the
voyeur
as
a
white
man
25
to
35
wearing
a
black
jacket
In
August
2014
according
to
a
Facebook
post
later
documented
in
a
police
report
a
Mare
Island
resident
who
heard
sounds
on
his
roof
late
one
night
saw
someone
fitting
a
similar
description
flee
with
a
ladder
The
resident
encountered
a
strange
man
on
two
other
occasions
One
night
the
man
was
crouching
under
the
resident
s
window
he
said
he
was
searching
for
his
puppy
a
husky
Another
night
the
resident
found
the
same
man
in
his
backyard
where
he
claimed
to
be
looking
for
531
Kirkland
Ave.
the
address
didn
t
exist
The
student
spotted
the
man
a
third
time
walking
a
young
husky
and
a
golden
retriever
According
to
a
Facebook
post
a
woman
who
lived
on
Klein
Avenue
a
block
from
Kirkland
said
that
her
neighbor
had
a
husky
and
a
golden
retriever
The
owner
of
the
Mustang
told
Carausu
that
he
d
heard
the
woman
s
neighbor
was
a
former
lawyer
who
had
been
in
the
military
Then
as
suddenly
as
the
Peeping
Tom
incidents
started
they
stopped
It
was
about
the
same
time
that
the
Vallejo
kidnapping
happened
the
Mustang
owner
told
Carausu
Why
does
that
ring
a
bell
she
thought
After
the
Dublin
home
invasion
and
Muller
s
arrest
a
colleague
of
Carausu
s
had
put
out
an
alert
asking
area
police
departments
for
information
about
similar
crimes
Vallejo
didn
t
respond
Online
Carausu
found
news
stories
about
the
kidnapping
which
occurred
three
months
earlier
She
noted
that
one
of
the
victims
had
blond
hair
Then
she
remembered
why
the
case
had
caught
her
attention
The
Vallejo
police
had
deemed
it
a
hoax

For
Matt
McAuliffe
I
Sometime
during
what
I
hoped
would
be
the
end
of
the
pandemic
I
found
myself
hungover
and
alone
in
my
front
yard
sweating
as
I
stared
at
the
piles
of
crap
I
had
to
cram
into
our
Subaru
piles
that
would
somehow
cohere
into
our
temporary
new
life
Fuck
me
I
said
And
fuck
this
My
family
and
I
were
leaving
for
the
summer
but
not
by
choice
I
work
at
a
boarding
school
Which
is
a
win
mostly
free
house
no
commute
but
sometimes
not
Like
when
a
virus
wreaks
havoc
on
a
global
scale
and
we
re
forced
to
vacate
so
the
school
can
fast-track
renovations
while
the
students
are
gone
I
hear
the
Torreys
are
moving
a
colleague
said
a
little
too
cheerfully
when
he
saw
me
on
my
walk
In
those
early
COVID
days
as
my
wife
and
I
struggled
to
work
without
childcare
I
burned
hours
marching
in
circles
with
my
kids
in
the
stroller
Not
exactly
I
said
through
my
mask
The
man
s
eyebrows
arched
They
re
installing
central
air
I
explained
So
we
re
moving
now
then
coming
home
in
August
to
move
back
in
Well
he
shrugged
at
least
you
ll
have
A/C
But
we
also
have
to
move
Twice
In
three
months
With
two
kids
All
while
the
world
is
falling
apart
Strange
times
he
said
But
you
ll
survive
But
complain
though
I
did
about
the
move
I
knew
deep
down
I
needed
a
change
Late
in
2019
my
wife
and
I
had
become
parents
for
the
second
time
and
after
a
long
paternity
leave
during
which
I
celebrated
my
younger
son
being
much
easier
than
his
brother
by
blasting
Marlboro
Reds
and
pounding
cheap
pinot
noir
I
decided
to
see
if
I
could
stop
drinking
Shockingly
I
could
All
through
January
as
the
booze
worked
its
way
from
my
system
I
felt
reborn
I
lost
weight
My
skin
glowed
People
kept
saying
there
was
light
in
my
eyes
By
February
I
marveled
at
why
I
d
blown
years
getting
wasted
in
the
first
place
Why
had
I
been
so
keen
to
embarrass
myself
to
black
out
and
barely
remember
the
nights
I
d
been
dying
to
enjoy
And
what
was
this
feeling
I
was
feeling
Then
I
realized
it
was
joy
or
at
least
the
absence
of
shame
When
you
re
not
constantly
hungover
it
turns
out
the
world
s
a
kinder
place
I
like
this
my
wife
told
me
as
we
sat
up
chatting
in
bed
Yeah
I
said
me
too
And
so
began
the
thinking
of
big
thoughts
While
I
bathed
my
sons
or
stayed
up
late
reading
I
swallowed
a
sad
truth
I
d
known
for
a
very
long
time
I
was
an
alcoholic
While
my
friends
all
had
bad
nights
for
me
it
was
different
I
was
always
drinking
almost
normally
then
abnormally
then
insanely
and
then
after
making
a
supreme
ass
of
myself
I
d
rein
it
in
only
to
begin
the
cycle
again
The
idea
of
saying
goodbye
was
scary
but
I
already
had
two
months
under
my
belt
All
I
had
to
do
was
keep
going
Kickstart
your
weekend
reading
by
getting
the
week
s
best
Longreads
delivered
to
your
inbox
every
Friday
afternoon
Sign
up
But
then
I
turned
35
and
got
smashed
drunk
The
night
was
unremarkable
My
wife
and
I
sipped
drinks
while
watching
the
BBC
s
Normal
People
She
quit
after
a
few
glasses
of
rosé
but
I
plowed
through
Negronis
until
I
passed
out
In
the
days
after
as
the
liquor
re-adhered
to
my
psyche
and
I
struggled
to
reckon
with
my
choice
to
get
fucked
up
the
news
all
at
once
became
all
about
COVID
One
day
Trump
banned
travel
from
Europe
On
another
New
York
friends
called
to
talk
through
plans
of
escape
Soon
after
we
were
all
in
the
middle
of
a
Global
Pandemic
Somewhere
in
all
this
I
found
myself
at
Costco
with
a
T-shirt
on
my
face
My
wife
had
sent
me
in
search
of
diapers
and
wipes
and
hopefully
a
gigantic
pallet
of
toilet
paper
but
there
I
was
as
if
by
magic
alone
in
the
liquor
department
filling
my
huge
shopping
cart
with
alcohol
and
not
just
the
normal
haul
of
tallboys
and
budget
wine
multiple
handles
of
whiskey
and
gin
What
the
fuck
am
I
doing
I
thought
as
a
sad-looking
lady
rang
me
up
But
then
of
course
I
knew
I
was
leaning
into
the
worst
of
my
instincts
telling
myself
without
telling
myself
that
if
the
world
didn
t
have
to
play
by
the
rules
neither
did
I
My
days
collapsed
into
a
parade
of
hangovers
so
bad
I
wanted
to
die
Each
morning
after
waking
in
agony
and
bearing
a
barrage
of
anger
from
my
wife
I
did
what
I
could
to
make
breakfast
for
my
kids
and
not
suffer
a
total
meltdown
as
they
turned
our
kitchen
into
a
shithouse
of
cereal
and
yogurt
And
then
somehow
unshowered
and
in
the
middle
of
a
five-alarm
headache
I
d
barricade
myself
in
my
bedroom
often
with
a
baby
on
my
lap
skim
poems
by
Marie
Howe
and
Adrienne
Rich
and
do
what
I
could
to
inspire
my
students
to
be
anything
more
than
what
the
pandemic
had
rendered
them
depressed
and
shell-shocked
little
thumbnails
too
naive
to
see
how
booze-whipped
I
was
and
too
good-natured
to
do
anything
as
reasonable
as
bitch
but
kids
who
d
nonetheless
devolved
from
pupils
I
adored
into
another
obstacle
between
waking
and
drinking
How
was
class
my
wife
asked
I
gave
her
a
dead-eyed
stare
as
I
put
the
boys
in
the
stroller
thinking
all
the
while
Must
Stop
Destroying
Self
When
night
fell
and
my
kids
were
asleep
I
d
practically
vibrate
at
the
notion
of
getting
drunk
I
knew
how
to
mix
a
drink
of
course
but
I
also
knew
I
d
need
six
drinks
to
feel
or
not
feel
the
way
I
wanted
to
I
also
knew
that
my
wife
s
patience
would
never
abide
that
many
But
two
that
could
be
done
So
I
made
my
first
as
strong
as
three
Most
often
I
drank
in
a
plastic
chair
in
my
front
yard
As
another
day
faded
I
marveled
at
life
s
strangeness
In
the
span
of
a
month
I
d
burned
down
my
nascent
sobriety
and
watched
the
pendulum
swing
so
hard
that
as
a
35-year-old
father
of
two
I
was
drinking
more
than
I
had
as
a
college
frat
boy
My
community
had
vanished
either
strictly
sequestered
or
gone
entirely
and
campus
felt
like
purgatory
Sometimes
I
d
FaceTime
friends
making
light
of
how
drunk
I
was
the
fucked-up
state
of
the
world
But
mostly
I
gazed
at
the
branches
of
a
chestnut
tree
watching
as
another
evening
fell
to
black
my
brain
all
the
while
making
sad
calculations
How
long
would
the
pandemic
last
Would
I
lose
my
job
Myself
Could
all
this
drinking
destroy
my
marriage
And
you
could
just
stop
I
thought
Be
a
good
husband
and
dad
and
teacher
and
resume
your
personhood
That
option
remained
But
so
did
the
other
one
the
one
where
I
kept
pushing
the
one
where
I
pretended
this
wouldn
t
only
get
worse
Besides
my
drink
was
empty
If
I
got
up
to
make
another
quickly
enough
my
wife
would
never
know
about
the
first
one
By
Easter
I
was
coming
apart
After
trying
in
vain
to
dye
brown
eggs
and
watching
my
older
son
lose
it
when
he
learned
he
couldn
t
eat
all
the
candy
in
his
basket
in
one
sitting
I
put
on
my
Mizunos
blasted
Fiona
Apple
That
s
where
the
pain
comes
in/like
a
second
skeleton
and
made
for
the
school
s
trails
Summer
was
coming
and
as
I
jogged
past
groves
of
walnut
trees
I
made
myself
believe
I
d
be
OK
Once
we
escaped
to
Habersham
South
Carolina
the
posh
community
where
my
wife
s
parents
and
aunts
and
uncles
had
all
retired
and
our
COVID
destination
our
problems
would
be
solved
I
d
be
born
again
in
the
Southern
heat
not
sober
but
sober-adjacent
My
in-laws
would
help
with
the
kids
I
d
get
some
writing
done
we
d
spend
afternoons
by
the
pool
and
the
evenings
would
be
a
pleasant
carousel
of
single
malt
scotch
and
peel-and-eat
shrimp
While
my
friends
all
had
bad
nights
for
me
it
was
different
I
was
always
drinking
almost
normally
then
abnormally
then
insanely
and
then
after
making
a
supreme
ass
of
myself
I
d
rein
it
in
only
to
begin
the
cycle
again
Rounding
a
bend
in
the
trails
I
made
out
a
lone
figure
the
school
s
French
teacher
who
I
hadn
t
seen
in
months
As
I
called
her
name
she
turned
and
shrank
Oh
Will
she
said
you
scared
me
She
d
just
come
back
from
New
York
where
friends
and
family
had
contracted
COVID
A
few
had
even
been
put
on
ventilators
Jesus
I
said
Yeah
They
might
like
actually
die
When
she
asked
about
my
family
I
wasted
no
time
in
lashing
out
at
the
school
for
making
us
move
at
Trump
for
mishandling
the
plague
at
the
drudgery
of
teaching
on
Zoom
As
I
got
more
and
more
riled
I
could
see
in
her
eyes
a
glimmer
of
alarm
Earlier
in
the
fall
my
wife
and
I
had
hosted
her
for
duck
à
l
orange
and
too
much
wine
and
we
stayed
up
past
midnight
trading
stories
and
cracking
up
Now
I
was
a
bloated
derelict
shouting
into
the
wind
And
my
drinking
I
said
Every
day
I
tell
myself
to
stop
But
I
can
t
I
sit
alone
and
drink
myself
into
oblivion
Oh
she
said
Sorry
I
said
I
just
–
No
no
It
s
okay
I
just
think
you
ve
got
ta
get
rid
of
the
alcohol
Just
get
all
the
bottles
and
pour
them
down
the
drain
Right
I
said
Back
home
I
told
my
wife
in
my
most
solemn
tone
I
was
done
drinking
For
how
long
Forever
or
at
least
until
the
world
goes
back
to
normal
That
night
as
we
set
the
table
for
lamb
chops
I
walked
into
the
kitchen
and
uncorked
a
bottle
of
red
And
this
was
just
the
way
life
was
For
a
hundred
days
as
a
murderous
virus
floated
through
the
air
I
drank
myself
into
a
hole
But
the
time
to
move
finally
arrived
The
Subaru
was
packed
All
that
lay
between
now
and
a
better
life
was
700
miles
of
I-95
As
I
locked
the
car
another
colleague
passed
this
time
the
school
s
biology
teacher
South
Carolina
tomorrow
she
asked
Come
hell
or
COVID-19
She
smiled
and
turned
but
stopped
Say
did
you
hear
about
that
woman
down
in
Kiawah
No
What
happened
The
biology
teacher
shook
her
head
Eaten
by
a
gator
II
The
heat
After
11
hours
barreling
down
the
interstate
past
Capitol
Harbor
past
South
of
the
Border
past
two
enormous
Confederate
flags
and
stopping
just
once
to
piss
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
Walmart
in
Bumfuck
North
Carolina
driving
on
and
on
with
two
kids
drunk
on
Benadryl
and
Sour
Skittles
the
noise
of
Raffi
blaring
all
the
while
after
all
that
what
I
remember
is
the
heat
All-enveloping
Time-stopping
Like
a
blanket
of
ennui
We
re
here
I
thought
and
as
soon
as
I
got
out
crunching
the
gravel
behind
our
townhouse
I
felt
the
sharp
sense
that
nothing
would
change
On
our
first
morning
after
a
night
alone
drinking
rum
in
the
bathtub
I
loaded
the
boys
and
set
out
on
an
hours-long
march
My
older
son
marveled
at
the
new
terrain
oak
trees
draped
in
Spanish
moss
camelia
and
foxtail
ferns
the
ground
alive
with
lizards
and
crabs
Somewhere
along
the
way
a
fat
old
man
buzzed
up
in
a
golf
cart
Y
all
be
careful
now
he
said
nodding
to
one
of
the
man-made
ponds
Momma
gator
up
the
way
Extra
territorial
What
did
he
say
my
son
asked
Nothing
Everything
s
fine
We
strolled
past
the
pool
and
along
the
marsh
We
listened
to
egrets
and
professional
power
washers
readying
rich
people
s
homes
for
the
summer
stopping
now
and
then
simply
to
marvel
at
this
place
our
swampy
little
hideaway
in
the
Low
Country
half
a
nation
away
from
the
cold
desolation
that
had
been
our
lot
Where
was
COVID
here
I
wondered
Even
the
notion
of
it
seemed
like
a
myth
People
down
here
didn
t
even
wear
masks
On
our
way
back
to
the
townhouse
we
crossed
a
footbridge
I
waved
to
two
teens
fishing
and
their
eyes
went
wide
Before
I
could
think
my
head
swiveled
to
a
patch
of
grass
where
an
enormous
alligator
basked
and
stared
at
my
children
How
long
would
it
take
I
wondered
for
this
beast
to
steal
my
kids
Ten
seconds
Five
Careful
one
boy
said
Yeah
I
told
him
thanks
Habersham
was
to
be
a
happy
place
It
was
not
My
wife
and
I
were
on
the
edge
of
a
meltdown
and
the
change
in
scenery
we
d
hoped
would
fix
us
had
only
made
things
worse
Within
days
after
we
d
worked
to
turn
the
half-furnished
home
of
a
family
friend
into
our
short-term
crash
pad
I
began
to
realize
that
just
as
I
d
fashioned
a
secret
fantasy
for
the
summer
one
wherein
I
kept
drinking
without
consequences
so
too
had
my
wife
Only
her
secret
fantasy
had
been
me
getting
my
shit
together
Everything
would
ve
been
better
had
we
made
time
to
talk
but
instead
we
lashed
out
My
wife
screamed
at
me
for
half-assing
the
assembly
of
our
new
bed
I
shouted
at
her
for
always
being
on
edge
My
wife
screamed
at
me
for
making
too
many
big
drinks
I
shouted
at
her
for
always
picking
fights
At
the
end
of
our
first
week
after
putting
the
kids
to
bed
she
found
me
slouched
at
the
granite
island
drinking
a
Double
Manhattan
You
fucking
drunk
she
screamed
eyes
bright
Just
sitting
here
getting
smashed
I
thought
of
the
neighbors
an
old
couple
who
unsure
of
COVID
etiquette
had
welcomed
me
to
the
block
with
a
fist
bump
If
she
shouted
any
louder
they
might
call
the
cops
The
only
time
we
have
to
breathe
she
went
on
the
only
time
we
have
to
think
and
you
re
just
down
here
knocking
yourself
out
I
d
like
to
say
I
poured
out
my
drink
I
d
like
to
say
I
said
sorry
But
what
I
did
instead
was
scream
back
Instead
we
yelled
until
our
faces
burned
and
then
sat
in
silence
at
a
bistro
table
on
the
porch
pushing
pesto
salmon
and
orzo
around
in
utter
silence
What
happened
was
my
wife
went
to
bed
early
and
I
stayed
up
getting
drunk
With
the
help
of
my
wife
s
parents
we
resumed
our
lives
In
the
mornings
my
in-laws
braved
the
heat
and
took
the
boys
on
walks
so
I
could
write
and
my
wife
could
work
In
the
afternoons
during
naptime
I
went
for
runs
and
ran
errands
while
my
wife
sat
on
Zoom
In
the
hours
before
bed
we
loaded
the
stroller
with
floaties
and
beers
and
walked
to
the
pool
where
rich
retirees
basked
in
the
sun
My
in-laws
came
over
for
dinner
and
most
nights
I
held
myself
together
at
least
while
they
were
there
One
night
alone
and
drunk
my
phone
lit
with
news
that
a
woman
in
Minneapolis
had
filmed
a
cop
killing
a
Black
man
I
told
myself
not
to
watch
but
in
the
stillness
of
the
screened-in
porch
I
felt
paralyzed
to
do
much
else
I
clicked
the
link
and
sipped
warm
gin
the
liquor
humming
through
me
as
I
watched
this
man
s
whole
being
slacken
from
anger
to
fear
to
resignation
and
then
death
I
set
down
my
phone
and
stared
at
the
fan
Slowly
spinning
and
spinning
I
watched
the
reel
again
Days
later
as
we
strolled
to
the
pool
my
wife
s
brother
called
to
say
our
sister-in-law
was
in
labor
with
our
second
niece
As
I
lounged
in
the
cold
water
greased
in
sunscreen
and
sipping
IPAs
I
couldn
t
stop
seeing
them
in
that
delivery
room
my
sister-in-law
doing
what
people
had
done
for
all
eternity
pushing
a
living
person
out
into
an
uncertain
world
Only
now
the
world
was
less
certain
than
ever
When
would
I
get
to
meet
this
baby
Would
she
be
healthy
Would
COVID
ruin
her
entire
childhood
For
a
hundred
days
as
a
murderous
virus
floated
through
the
air
I
drank
myself
into
a
hole
But
the
time
to
move
finally
arrived
The
Subaru
was
packed
All
that
lay
between
now
and
a
better
life
was
700
miles
of
I-95
That
evening
we
sat
on
my
in-laws
porch
sipping
French
chardonnay
and
doing
our
best
to
answer
these
questions
doing
our
best
I
think
not
to
feel
lucky
that
our
own
kids
had
been
born
before
this
started
As
the
sun
fell
into
the
trees
by
the
marsh
we
said
good
night
and
made
for
the
stroller
But
just
as
we
turned
we
heard
a
strange
noise
a
dull
thud
a
crashing
I
cut
my
eyes
in
time
to
see
what
I
was
sure
was
a
rolled-up
rug
landing
after
a
toss
down
a
porch
staircase
Is
that
a
person
my
mother-in-law
asked
No
I
said
but
then
I
saw
that
it
was
an
old
lady
moaning
on
the
ground
*Some
names
have
been
changed
to
protect
privacy
As
my
mother-in-law
and
I
ran
over
I
remembered
who
she
was
Elaine
*
a
reclusive
drinker
who
apart
from
lashing
out
at
members
of
Habersham
s
yard
crew
or
leaving
terse
notes
on
illegally
parked
cars
as
she
d
once
done
to
mine
was
essentially
a
hermit
Just
a
lonesome
old
woman
waiting
things
out
She
was
an
injured
animal
when
we
got
to
her
a
little
ball
of
pain
in
the
grass
It
was
90
degrees
out
yet
she
wore
slippers
sweatpants
and
a
thick
cotton
top
She
reached
for
my
arm
I
was
just
putting
out
repellent
Repellent
For
the
deer
We
better
call
an
ambulance
my
mother-in-law
said
No
no
Just
get
me
back
inside
The
light
caught
her
face
then
and
when
my
gaze
met
hers
I
watched
a
hematoma
over
her
eyebrow
balloon
from
a
marble
to
a
golf
ball
You
re
hurt
I
said
Maybe
badly
I
was
just
putting
out
the
repellent
My
mother-in-law
looked
at
her
neighbor
Elaine
would
it
be
all
right
if
Will
carried
you
in
I
hoisted
Elaine
s
hundred
pounds
over
my
shoulder
and
climbed
the
stairs
down
which
she
d
just
tumbled
the
stairs
that
had
she
fallen
differently
might
ve
killed
her
Elaine
s
clothes
were
stained
and
filthy
Her
toenails
gnarled
and
black
When
I
got
her
back
in
I
understood
the
warm
clothes
The
thermostat
was
so
low
that
the
sweat
on
my
body
became
a
sheet
of
ice
and
as
I
laid
her
on
the
couch
I
shivered
While
my
mother-in-law
sussed
out
whether
it
was
safe
to
leave
Elaine
I
took
in
the
room
White
sofa
and
loveseat
high-end
and
pristine
A
beautiful
glass
table
spread
thick
with
Southern
Living
and
House
Beautiful
And
there
at
center
stage
before
the
couch
that
served
as
the
setting
for
most
of
her
life
was
a
huge
plastic
cup
brimming
with
white
wine
Do
you
know
what
day
it
is
I
asked
She
did
Do
you
know
who
the
president
is
She
did
The
hematoma
grew
bigger
Elaine
thanked
me
again
and
again
but
I
knew
deep
down
she
was
mortified
She
just
wanted
us
to
leave
so
she
could
get
back
to
drinking
to
black
out
and
forget
all
this
happened
You
call
me
my
mother-in-law
told
her
If
your
head
starts
hurting
we
ll
get
you
to
the
hospital
As
we
marched
home
my
mother-in-law
was
silent
I
just
can
t
believe
it
I
said
I
mean
to
give
your
life
over
to
booze
like
that
It
…
it
s
A
shame
Yes
I
said
Then
I
went
home
and
got
drunk
We
trudged
through
the
days
In
the
mornings
I
wrote
stories
about
alcoholic
teachers
and
went
for
long
runs
I
read
novels
by
Philip
Roth
and
James
Salter
and
Michael
Chabon
In
the
evenings
we
watched
the
boys
swim
and
shot
the
shit
with
other
young
couples
all
of
whom
upon
hearing
the
events
that
lead
us
from
a
shut-down
boarding
school
to
Habersham
never
failed
to
say
how
lucky
we
were
And
it
was
true
While
Americans
shuttered
restaurants
and
struggled
to
file
for
unemployment
we
lived
in
a
half-million
dollar
townhouse
and
took
meandering
strolls
to
the
luxury
pool
While
the
death
count
ticked
up
and
up
we
barely
thought
of
COVID
and
when
we
did
it
was
in
the
abstract
some
faraway
tragedy
like
a
famine
in
the
Sahara
something
that
was
sad
but
didn
t
have
much
to
do
with
us
Nonetheless
we
felt
trapped
and
exhausted
Nonetheless
every
night
was
the
same
Whether
I
drank
rye
or
gin
or
red
or
white
I
drank
too
much
I
drank
to
the
point
that
I
had
to
be
careful
getting
up
from
my
chair
to
the
point
where
watching
a
movie
was
pointless
because
I
d
never
remember
it
Every
morning
I
woke
to
the
sting
of
another
body-shaking
hangover
and
every
morning
I
d
tell
myself
enough
But
every
evening
as
I
popped
the
cork
on
another
bottle
of
Campuget
I
smiled
and
thought
this
time
it
ll
be
different
One
morning
my
older
son
startled
me
as
I
vacuumed
In
his
hands
he
held
an
old
stethoscope
left
behind
by
the
previous
tenant
I
set
down
the
Dyson
and
knelt
beside
him
What
do
you
have
bubba
Teth-a-scope
He
stuck
in
the
earpieces
and
put
the
bell
to
his
chest
Do
you
hear
it
I
asked
Boom-boom
boom-boom
He
moved
the
bell
to
my
chest
and
looked
right
at
me
That
s
you
daddy
That
s
your
heart
Another
night
drunk
and
alone
on
the
screened-in
porch
My
phone
blinked
with
a
flurry
of
texts
Old
friends
all
weighing
in
on
another
police
killing
This
time
the
Black
man
was
Rayshard
Brooks
Why
did
he
run
What
was
he
thinking
He
shouldn
t
have
been
driving
in
the
first
place
They
should
ve
shot
him
in
the
leg
I
tossed
my
phone
and
swigged
warm
gin
feeling
flaccid
and
angry
My
phone
lit
again
this
time
with
friends
from
the
first
chain
making
a
new
chain
to
talk
shit
They
re
so
narrow-minded
And
offensive
And
racist
Do
you
think
they
ve
even
seen
the
video
I
realized
then
I
hadn
t
seen
it
myself
I
finished
my
gin
and
loaded
the
reel
And
as
I
drunkenly
watched
an
over-the-line
guy
getting
arrested
for
passing
out
in
a
Wendy
s
drive-thru
and
then
trying
drunkenly
to
run
only
to
be
shot
to
death
I
felt
completely
unstuck
from
reality
While
a
virus
that
virtually
no
one
in
South
Carolina
could
be
bothered
to
take
seriously
was
straining
our
nation
s
hospitals
while
the
notion
of
ever
going
back
to
normal
remained
totally
unclear
I
was
drunk
on
a
porch
watching
another
Black
guy
get
murdered
She
was
an
injured
animal
when
we
got
to
her
a
little
ball
of
pain
in
the
grass
I
called
one
of
my
friends
from
the
chain
We
talked
a
long
time
about
how
terrible
it
was
and
how
terrible
we
d
been
as
a
couple
of
LSU
frat
boys
how
we
d
never
done
a
thing
but
chase
girls
and
get
blasted
how
we
d
never
so
much
as
thought
to
wonder
what
it
might
be
like
to
be
anyone
other
than
us
We
both
did
and
said
things
we
shouldn
t
have
I
said
My
friend
sighed
When
I
look
back
on
the
guy
I
was
I
don
t
feel
proud
By
the
time
our
call
ended
the
booze
in
my
blood
had
become
self-righteous
You
know
I
typed
on
the
original
chain
if
the
police
found
my
drunk
ass
passed
out
in
a
car
and
I
tried
to
run
or
do
anything
even
halfway
threatening
no
cop
in
America
would
ever
shoot
me
I
hit
send
and
geared
up
for
an
argument
but
before
long
I
passed
out
When
I
came
to
hours
later
sweaty
and
confused
and
still
on
the
porch
no
one
had
replied
I
made
my
way
to
the
door
which
was
somehow
locked
My
wife
had
been
asleep
for
hours
a
reasonable
human
being
getting
rest
before
another
day
of
work
without
childcare
I
pictured
her
wrapped
in
the
sheets
snoring
softly
and
my
whole
self
filled
with
rage
Sleeping
outside
struck
me
as
the
ultimate
indignity
I
pounded
the
windows
until
I
thought
the
glass
might
shatter
Goddamnit
I
screamed
into
the
night
You
re
so
fucking
…
annoying
When
my
wife
got
up
to
let
me
in
she
spoke
only
one
sentence
You
know
you
locked
yourself
out
right
On
the
Fourth
of
July
we
made
our
way
to
my
wife
s
aunt
s
place
just
a
short
walk
from
the
townhouse
After
scrambled
egg
casserole
and
fruit
salad
we
gathered
on
the
porch
to
watch
the
parade
As
we
sipped
mimosas
James
Habersham
Street
came
alive
in
a
chain
of
tipsy
white
people
in
golf
carts
done
up
in
patriotic
crepe
paper
and
Uncle
Sam
balloons
Families
along
either
side
of
the
oak-lined
road
shouted
and
waved
and
as
my
older
son
hopped
from
one
foot
to
the
other
unable
to
contain
his
thrill
about
another
holiday
that
to
him
meant
nothing
I
refilled
my
mimosa
and
looked
at
my
phone
It
hadn
t
occurred
to
me
until
then
to
wonder
who
James
Habersham
was
but
a
quick
Google
yielded
that
he
was
not
only
a
slave
owner
but
a
slave
owner
against
American
independence
As
the
parade
rolled
and
the
champagne
settled
I
thought
of
making
a
comment
or
at
least
a
joke
something
to
acknowledge
the
absurdity
Here
we
were
Americans
celebrating
America
by
watching
rich
Americans
cruise
along
a
road
named
for
a
person
who
not
only
loved
slavery
but
hated
America
Not
a
single
reveler
wore
a
mask
Not
a
single
placard
bore
any
slogan
reminding
us
to
KEEP
OUR
DISTANCE
or
REMEMBER
GEORGE
FLOYD
or
RAYSHARD
BROOKS
And
where
are
their
families
I
wanted
to
ask
What
are
they
up
to
this
Independence
Day
And
everyone
on
ventilators
what
about
them
and
the
people
they
love
But
then
the
parade
ended
and
the
bar
shut
down
I
packed
the
boys
into
the
stroller
for
the
eighty-billionth
time
and
began
to
dread
the
hours
ahead
It
was
barely
11
a.
m.
and
I
was
drunk
and
dehydrated
and
deeply
tired
with
hours
to
go
before
naptime
I
sighed
a
long
sigh
unlocked
the
brake
and
slowly
pushed
my
children
home
If
you
hang
around
the
pool
long
enough
you
re
bound
to
make
friends
and
as
July
drew
to
a
close
we
did
just
that
Jason
and
Jenna
were
our
age
and
had
a
set
of
twin
boys
right
between
our
sons
After
a
handful
of
afternoons
swimming
and
chatting
Jenna
invited
us
to
join
them
for
a
twilight
boat
ride
To
be
clear
Jenna
said
this
is
a
booze
cruise
The
day
of
I
kept
catching
myself
feeling
nervous
it
d
been
so
long
since
we
d
hung
out
with
a
new
couple
I
might
not
know
how
to
act
My
solution
was
drinking
That
afternoon
on
our
walk
to
the
pool
I
guzzled
a
huge
rosé
then
tore
through
IPAs
with
total
abandon
By
the
time
we
got
to
Jenna
and
Jason
s
it
was
already
too
late
The
night
itself
was
gorgeous
Jason
zoomed
us
out
past
the
marsh
and
into
the
open
water
where
we
bobbed
together
eating
fancy
cheese
and
pounding
red
wine
We
motored
about
in
the
blue-gray
night
my
wife
leaning
into
me
the
whole
time
a
smile
on
her
face
enjoying
a
perfect
evening
with
her
husband
in
such
a
pretty
place
But
the
deal
of
my
blackout
was
already
sealed
I
kept
up
the
banter
as
long
as
I
could
trading
stories
about
my
years
in
New
Orleans
about
writing
and
teaching
but
by
the
time
we
got
back
to
dry
land
I
could
no
longer
be
counted
on
to
get
my
thoughts
from
my
head
to
my
mouth
I
could
be
counted
on
only
for
the
insane
sense
that
no
matter
what
I
needed
to
keep
drinking
As
the
night
ended
and
we
made
our
way
back
to
Jason
and
Jenna
s
I
invited
myself
in
for
a
nightcap
a
drink
I
ll
never
recall
In
my
wife
s
telling
we
didn
t
stay
long
and
though
I
didn
t
make
a
fool
of
myself
I
did
go
completely
silent
staring
up
at
the
night
sky
and
slugging
back
beer
Once
we
d
gotten
home
I
assumed
I
d
made
a
beeline
to
pass
out
but
instead
I
hunched
like
an
animal
at
the
kitchen
island
gorging
myself
on
whatever
I
pulled
from
the
fridge
I
woke
the
next
dawn
with
the
scum
of
chips
and
pork
chops
on
my
tongue
and
no
recall
of
how
the
night
ended
My
brain
made
a
million
scenarios
I
d
made
some
lewd
comment
to
Jesse
I
d
pissed
my
pants
or
exposed
myself
Like
always
none
of
these
things
had
happened
But
like
always
the
shame
in
my
chest
could
not
have
felt
heavier
Everywhere
you
go
you
embarrass
yourself
I
whispered
in
bed
before
my
wife
came
in
Every
time
you
meet
someone
you
show
them
you
re
a
fool
III
Somehow
it
got
worse
I
started
cracking
bottles
of
rosé
at
3
p.
m.
then
2:30
I
could
no
longer
have
just
a
beer
on
the
way
to
the
pool
I
couldn
t
be
counted
on
to
form
a
sentence
after
sundown
I
began
to
avoid
my
wife
in
favor
of
sweating
alone
on
the
porch
pounding
wine
and
FaceTiming
friends
friends
who
stopped
answering
At
some
point
my
wife
started
to
film
me
her
sad
subject
in
his
sad
little
TV
chair
eyes
glazed
face
slack
grunting
and
swatting
at
her
phone
when
I
realized
what
she
was
doing
On
the
last
day
of
July
after
my
in-laws
and
I
took
my
wife
out
for
her
38th
birthday
our
first
time
in
a
restaurant
since
the
pandemic
began
my
wife
and
I
put
the
boys
to
bed
Earlier
that
afternoon
we
d
gone
to
the
liquor
store
and
carefully
selected
four
bottles
of
nice
wine
and
as
my
wife
yawned
and
began
to
wind
down
she
asked
me
nicely
not
to
drink
it
It
s
good
stuff
she
said
I
agreed
We
should
save
it
for
having
people
over
I
agreed
And
then
she
went
to
sleep
There
are
no
memories
Only
flashes
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
call
a
friend
who
does
not
answer
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
call
another
friend
who
does
not
answer
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
switch
on
a
movie
I
m
too
drunk
to
watch
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
I
hit
FaceTime
on
my
college
text
chain
and
somehow
connect
with
all
of
them
at
once
on
video
and
watch
as
their
faces
crumble
from
looks
of
excitement
to
looks
of
fret
I
stand
from
my
sad
little
TV
chair
and
go
to
the
island
to
get
more
wine
Once
we
d
gotten
home
I
assumed
I
d
made
a
beeline
to
pass
out
but
instead
I
hunched
like
an
animal
at
the
kitchen
island
gorging
myself
on
whatever
I
pulled
from
the
fridge
Time
is
gone
I
feel
no
feelings
a
man
hiding
from
himself
I
get
more
wine
I
get
more
wine
I
am
a
man
failing
The
next
morning
light
streamed
through
the
shutters
and
bathed
the
wreck
of
me
in
a
soft
warm
glow
When
my
wife
came
in
she
did
not
speak
did
not
have
to
so
clear
was
the
pain
in
her
eyes
I
m
finished
I
said
The
words
came
without
thought
My
wife
looked
out
the
windows
I
m
finished
I
said
again
I
ll
never
quite
know
why
it
happened
then
Why
not
the
day
prior
or
10
years
back
Why
not
never
All
I
know
is
if
you
re
a
person
surrounded
by
love
you
re
lucky
All
I
know
is
if
you
re
a
drunk
you
either
stop
drinking
or
you
die
a
drunk
I
stood
poured
coffee
and
rubbed
the
heads
of
my
two
children
I
kissed
their
fat
cheeks
and
made
for
the
porch
I
phoned
my
brother-
and
sister-in-law
then
my
in-laws
I
m
sorry
I
said
and
they
said
they
loved
me
I
lost
myself
I
said
and
they
said
that
I
had
I
held
my
wife
and
said
over
and
over
how
ashamed
I
was
I
m
sorry
I
m
sorry
I
m
sorry
Later
that
morning
we
drove
the
boys
to
Port
Royal
where
there
was
a
grubby
beach
but
a
beach
nonetheless
They
called
it
the
Redneck
Riviera
Once
the
kids
lost
themselves
stomping
in
tide
pools
and
chasing
tiny
crabs
I
drifted
to
the
parking
lot
and
pulled
out
my
phone
I
hammered
out
a
text
to
all
my
close
friends
After
a
bad
few
months
I
ve
made
the
decision
to
quit
drinking
I
m
not
going
to
AA
I
am
just
tired
of
being
this
version
of
myself
I
can
not
be
a
drunk
while
raising
these
boys
I
know
I
have
your
support
The
replies
came
fast
and
though
every
person
said
it
differently
every
message
was
the
same
This
is
good
This
is
right
We
love
you
You
will
never
regret
this
one
friend
said
Yeah
I
said
but
what
about
–
You
will
never
regret
this
he
said
again
The
sun
moved
shadows
lengthened
There
was
a
breeze
and
seafoam
and
the
crashing
of
waves
My
wife
watched
the
children
and
I
watched
my
wife
The
wine
burned
in
my
veins
and
my
head
throbbed
but
once
it
was
done
I
told
myself
it
d
be
done
for
good
I
d
endured
nearly
six
months
of
self-destruction
I
saw
then
I
had
no
plan
for
where
to
go
from
here
but
in
my
heart
scared
and
bruised
though
it
was
I
knew
it
didn
t
matter
All
that
mattered
was
I
was
here
All
that
mattered
was
I
was
having
this
moment
We
ve
been
talking
about
coming
here
all
summer
my
wife
said
as
we
strapped
the
boys
back
in
their
car
seats
Well
I
m
glad
we
finally
made
it
Yeah
she
said
Me
too
Days
later
sober
as
a
judge
before
my
laptop
in
the
townhouse
s
dining
room
a
room
where
few
meals
had
been
eaten
but
where
I
d
written
through
hangovers
all
summer
long
I
logged
in
for
my
first
session
with
a
therapist
My
counselor
a
hardy
and
whip-smart
Harley-Davidson
enthusiast
comically
named
Dr
Bliss
told
me
all
the
ways
she
could
help
me
and
as
she
neared
the
end
of
her
spiel
she
paused
So
how
old
are
you
she
asked
Thirty-five
And
who
will
you
be
at
50
My
mind
did
the
math
My
son
I
said
My
older
son
will
be
a
senior
in
high
school
She
smiled
But
who
will
you
be
The
right
answers
were
obvious
Sober
A
better
husband
and
dad
and
writer
But
what
I
said
was
I
just
want
to
be
a
person
who
loves
himself
A
person
who
gives
love
I
want
to
know
why
I
ve
hurt
myself
for
so
many
years
She
nodded
and
laughed
What
s
funny
You
re
so
introspective
And
hard
on
yourself
I
guess
I
m
just
wondering
why
it
took
you
so
long
to
start
therapy
I
answered
without
thinking
Because
I
knew
they
d
tell
me
to
quit
drinking
IV
At
summer
s
end
my
family
my
wife
s
family
and
all
the
kids
and
grandkids
made
the
trip
north
for
a
week
in
Cape
May
New
Jersey
In
our
days
there
wrangling
toddlers
beside
the
Atlantic
wandering
from
one
rental
to
the
next
in
an
endless
loop
of
family
lunches
happy
hours
and
dinners
I
never
once
brought
up
my
choice
to
quit
I
chased
my
sons
on
the
beach
made
chitchat
over
dinner
without
wine
by
my
plate
and
brimmed
glass
after
glass
with
fizzy
water
and
lime
One
morning
while
everyone
else
loaded
carts
with
sunscreen
and
plastic
pails
for
another
day
on
the
shore
I
drove
two
hours
back
to
our
campus
home
to
supervise
while
movers
got
all
our
belongings
back
into
place
The
new
A/C
outpaced
the
August
heat
with
ease
and
as
I
watched
a
crew
of
burly
tattooed
dudes
lug
sofas
and
cribs
around
corners
and
up
stairs
I
had
the
sense
that
all
that
d
happened
here
the
pandemic
the
beginning
of
my
bad
days
had
been
erased
Must
be
weird
the
crew
boss
said
Moving
back
into
your
old
place
My
man
I
told
him
you
have
no
idea
Our
final
morning
in
Cape
May
was
nothing
special
just
harried
people
scrambling
to
pack
Everyone
was
hungover
and
grumpy
Everyone
except
for
me
Down
in
the
garage
we
said
goodbye
to
my
mother-
and
father-in-law
my
brother-
and
sister-in-law
and
their
two
little
girls
We
did
one
final
sweep
and
made
for
the
Subaru
I
started
the
engine
and
looked
at
my
wife
Are
we
ready
I
think
so
she
said
And
we
were
The
boys
were
strapped
in
we
had
plenty
of
masks
and
Raffi
shouted
from
the
speakers
Now
s
the
time
to
rise
and
shine
We
re
going
home
I
thought
and
for
that
I
was
thankful
Now
all
I
had
to
do
was
live
the
rest
of
my
life

Anti-abortion
advocates
seeking
to
overturn
Roe
v
Wade
would
have
you
think
that
the
practice
of
terminating
pregnancies
is
a
new
phenomenon
brought
on
by
the
rise
of
feminism
and
the
imaginary
moral
decay
of
America
As
Tamara
Dean
lays
bare
in
this
essay
this
is
nothing
short
of
a
lie
Surveying
historical
literature
and
using
Nancy
Ann
Harris
a
woman
who
died
in
1876
in
a
rural
Wisconsin
county
as
a
lens
into
the
past
Dean
shows
how
abortion
was
a
legally
and
morally
acceptable
way
for
a
woman
to
care
for
her
health
until
misogynistic
racist
forces
decided
it
shouldn
t
be
Every
woman
including
Nancy
would
have
known
friends
sisters
or
cousins
who
died
or
were
debilitated
while
giving
birth
Dean
writes
They
would
have
known
those
who
took
pains
to
avoid
it
This
essay
is
a
necessary
corrective
and
beautifully
written
to
boot

As
a
kid
growing
up
Jewish
in
a
very
not-Jewish
part
of
the
country
I
was
always
fascinated
to
hear
about
places
where
communities
had
taken
root
in
seemingly
very
not-Jewish
parts
of
the
larger
world
Ethiopia
India
China
Yet
before
reading
Samanth
Subramanian
s
deeply
descriptive
travelog
in
The
Guardian
I
was
unaware
of
a
much
newer
version
of
the
phenomenon
happening
in
Nigeria
Estimates
vary
but
thousands
of
native
Nigerians
have
taken
up
the
faith
in

Can

Arroyo
Seco
Tiny
Home
Village
along

freeway
which
was
built
to
help

transition
out
of
houselessness
But
the
village
s
dehumanizing
rules
and
inhospitable
conditions
create
anything
but
a
safe
and
secure
environment
and
no
amount
of
whimsy
in
the
form
of
colorful
cheery
murals
can
hide
the
carceral
nature
of
the
camp
Tiny
sheds
must
be
understood
not
as
homes
or
as
housing

writes

as
an
architecture

In
this
thoughtful
essay
at
Lit
Hub
Steve
Edwards
contemplates
what
it
means
to
be
considered
dangerous
whether
that
danger
is
in
the
form
of
words
ideas
beliefs
or
violence
As
Edwards
considers
what
danger
means
and
the
forms
it
can
take
he
looks
at
conscientious
objectors
Boston
Marathon
bomber
Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev
as
well
as
his
own
creative
writing
students
as
they
struggle
to
make
a
life
for
themselves
and
earn
a
living
in
America
Nineteen
is
a
liminal
age
Absent
a
chance
to
define
ourselves
other
forces
stand
at
the
ready
to
do
so
for
us—family
members
cultural
traditions
career
trajectories…Essays
are
made
things
I
tell
them
equal
parts
critical
thinking
and
creative
engagement
I
suggest
that
if
they
can
change
words
on
a
page
they
might
also
change
their
lives
Had
Tsarnaev
been
a
student
in
my
class
I
might
have
encouraged
him
to
write
about
his
experiences
as
an
immigrant
or
what
drew
him
to
want
to
study
sea
life…Those
most
likely
to
tell
the
truth
about
their
lives
are
the
ones
with
nothing
left
to
lose…Unfortunately
you
can
t
escape
an
ideology
by
hoping
it
changes
You
end
up
becoming
it
instead…In
my
classes
a
pen
is
a
tool
for
expanding
a
student
s
potential
not
limiting
it
through
fear

I
don
t
remember
the
first
time
I
saw
the
water
rise
There
is
no
moment
in
my
memory
that
stands
out
as
a
shift
the
water
has
always
been
impossible
to
ignore
I
spent
my
teenage
years
in
Charleston
South
Carolina
floating
on
paddleboards
down
roads
turned
to
rivers
wading
through
floodwater
to
reach
my
car
There
was
joy
and
then
fear
as
school
would
be
canceled
for
days
at
a
time
due
to
incoming
hurricanes
all
the
businesses
on
the
peninsula
boarding
up
their
windows
in
preparation
All
the
while
it
seemed
normal
an
essential
facet
of
life
in
the
coastal
South
The
water
was
always
there
in
the
background
rising
and
then
falling
I
did
not
think
to
worry
or
wonder
or
wait
for
the
places
I
call
home
to
sink
Now
as
I
have
grown
older
and
the
water
has
grown
closer
and
higher
I
worry
I
pore
over
statistics
about
how
long
these
places
have
imagining
life
without
them
Every
time
I
am
home
and
I
walk
along
the
wall
that
holds
the
coastline
below
I
wonder
how
long
it
will
be
before
this
path
is
gone
before
this
street
is
gone
Before
this
whole
place
is
gone
and
me
with
it
Because
whether
I
like
it
or
not
there
will
come
a
day
where
we
will
not
be
able
to
hold
the
water
out
It
might
be
in
20
years
or
it
might
be
in
80
but
it
is
inevitable
How
do
you
cope
with
that
reality
How
do
you
love
a
place
that
is
sinking
I
spent
my
entire
life
waiting
to
leave
the
South
thinking
I
would
only
find
happiness
away
from
here
but
now
that
it
is
disappearing
I
find
I
can
not
look
away
I
am
desperate
to
find
ways
to
archive
my
home
To
preserve
it
To
create
a
memory
of
a
place
that
can
last
beyond
it
a
memorial
of
sorts
I
suppose
But
that
memorial
does
not
have
to
overcome
it
can
not
and
should
not
be
the
only
story
we
tell
ourselves
even
in
the
midst
of
it
There
can
still
be
celebration
appreciation
and
hope
existing
at
the
same
time
There
is
of
course
pain
in
these
places
dark
histories
and
troubled
waters
but
there
is
newfound
joy
too
There
is
love
and
hope
and
a
belief
in
resurrection
being
poured
into
the
modern
South
by
the
artists
writers
musicians
documentarians
and
individuals
who
call
it
home
It
is
beautiful
and
it
is
redemptive
These
stories
show
that
force
they
are
at
once
both
love
letters
and
critiques
memorials
and
memories
creating
an
archive
of
a
common
place
This
story
from
Lauren
Groff
about
a
climate
refugee
and
the
aftermath
of
a
wave
that
wipes
out
a
whole
coastline
in
minutes
is
beautifully
done
Groff
has
written
candidly
about
her
home
state
of
Florida
but
this
story
speaks
in
descriptive
prose
about
an
experience
bound
to
become
more
frequent
as
natural
disasters
increase
The
Bitter
Southerner
is
one
of
the
best
publications
right
now
truly
Much
of
their
journalism
focuses
on
climate
and
nature
in
the
modern
South
I
love
this
piece
from
Boyce
Upholt
about
the
largest
river
swamp
in
the
United
States
which
is
slowly
sinking
He
poses
a
great
question
that
I
find
especially
relevant
for
today
s
South
How
do
you
preserve
a
landscape
when
the
only
constant
is
change
The
Atchafalaya
Basin
in
Louisiana
is
a
floodway
that
protects
the
entire
South
from
rising
water
levels
In
this
piece
Upholt
reflects
on
the
history
of
the
swamp
the
mythology
of
the
region
and
learning
to
live
with
change
a
lesson
especially
important
as
time
goes
on
As
he
says
Belle
Boggs
writes
about
how
we
tell
stories
about
our
world
especially
in
regard
to
how
we
process
a
changing
climate
Through
a
reflection
on
parenthood
and
raising
her
daughter
in
rural
North
Carolina
she
looks
at
our
communal
role
as
unreliable
narrators
who
want
to
be
both
honest
and
optimistic
about
where
our
future
with
climate
change
stands
She
also
examines
the
education
system
and
the
ways
we
teach
climate
change
in
the
rural
South
if
we
teach
it
at
all
I
appreciate
and
agree
with
Boggs
view
that
one
of
our
roles
as
artists
is
to
become
documentarians
chronicling
this
specific
moment
in
time
Art
movements
such
as
The
Dark
Mountain
Project
often
discuss
how
our
art
must
begin
to
engage
with
the
new
world
around
us
rather
than
living
in
a
fictional
past
and
I
think
Boggs
does
a
great
job
of
showing
that
intersection
of
documentation
reflection
and
cautionary
hope
in
this
piece
In
moments
of
crisis
art
is
a
force
that
can
help
us
process
When
we
can
not
find
the
words
ourselves
we
turn
to
the
words
of
others
whether
those
be
in
music
poetry
fiction
or
film
For
Scalawag
Sergio
Lopez
reflects
on
the
history
of
music
in
response
to
coastal
flooding
tracing
it
back
to
the
Great
Flood
of
1927
that
washed
out
the
Mississippi
and
the
Black
musicians
who
poured
out
music
testifying
to
the
destruction
Then
and
now
music
has
helped
us
to
bear
witness
and
from
that
to
ask
for
change
But
Lopez
also
warns
of
the
consequences
of
separating
these
songs
which
he
compiles
in
a
playlist
including
everything
from
Eric
Clapton
to
Lil
Wayne
to
Charley
Patton
to
Led
Zeppelin
from
their
historical
and
intended
meaning

Writer
Meghan
Mayhew
Bergman
reflects
for
The
Guardian
on
the
disappearing
highways
in
her
childhood
home
of
coastal
North
Carolina
As
she
drove
along
Highway
12
a
road
along
the
Carolina
coast
s
barrier
islands
she
ruminated
on
change
and
the
inevitably
of
it
There
is
a
precarity
to
loving
places
that
we
know
will
disappear
a
tenacious
joy
in
finding
home
in
what
we
are
bound
to
lose
It
has
been
one
of
the
core
facets
of
my
own
Southern
journey
as
I
grew
up
here
left
and
returned
only
to
learn
what
I
returned
to
could
never
last
Beyond
climate
coastal
towns
thrive
on
tourism
and
in
turn
have
suffered
the
effects
of
rampant
gentrification
the
places
I
once
used
to
find
familiar
are
at
best
changed
and
at
worst
gone
The
main
theme
I
have
found
in
all
the
writing
of
the
coastal
South
I
have
pored
over
the
last
few
years
is
that
change
is
inevitable
Whether
in
the
form
of
climate
disasters
rising
floodwaters
or
small
towns
falling
to
development
projects
it
will
come
The
point
to
stop
it
is
long
past
us
What
is
important
now
is
how
we
learn
to
live
with
it
how
we
learn
to
make
homes
in
all
of
this
ruin
How
we
can
even
learn
to
love
them

a
process
failing
everyone
but

So
much
of
our
work
with

in

is
related
to
memory
what
we
remember
now
and
what
we
will
remember

One

news
about

coming
up

I
asked
my
father
as
usual
if
he
would
evacuate
He
said
he
wouldn
t
that
he
was
ready
for
the
rain
He
wrote
back
to
me
like
some
kind
of
solem
prophet
For
me
water
is
everything
needful
yet
hiding
the
wrath
of
God
Quench
my
thirst
yet
I
can
drown
in
2

there
could
be

Leap
or

into

and
smash

or

on
a
rock
the

the
river

I
am
bowling
along
beneath
overhanging
peach
and
mulberry
trees
recalls
Thomas
Stevens
in
the
19th
chapter
of
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
following
a
volunteer
horseman
to
Mohammed
Ali
Khan
s
garden
Before
reaching
the
garden
a
gang
of
bare-legged
laborers
engaged
in
patching
up
a
mud
wall
favor
me
with
a
fusillade
of
stones
one
of
which
caresses
my
ankle
and
makes
me
limp
like
a
Greenwich
pensioner
when
I
dismount
a
minute
or
two
afterward…
Like
many
travel
writers
Thomas
Stevens
wrote
in
the
first
person
He
also
wrote
in
the
present
tense
so
everything
he
recounts
feels
immediate
as
if
his
journey
is
unfolding
in
real
time
Over
the
course
of
many
hundreds
of
pages
the
reader
travels
with
Stevens
eats
with
Stevens
weathers
rainstorms
with
Stevens
When
Stevens
outwits
thieves
in
Persia
we
re
right
there
with
him
When
he
listens
to
Hungarian
Gypsy
music
in
Serbia
we
hear
it
too
When
he
narrowly
evades
a
herd
of
stampeding
mustangs
in
the
American
frontier
we
also
duck
and
cover
With
every
crank
of
his
pedal
we
ride
alongside
absorbing
the
same
sensations
But
there
s
one
thing
missing
from
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
Stevens
mammoth
memoir
from
1887
the
author
himself
Nowhere
in
his
two
volumes
and
41
chapters
does
Stevens
bother
to
explain
why
he
decided
to
ride
a
penny-farthing
across
three
continents
He
never
once
mentions
his
parents
his
childhood
or
a
prior
career
Even
his
titular
bicycle
which
carries
him
13,500
miles
over
mountains
and
deserts
has
no
origin
story
it
simply
appears
out
of
the
ether
The
first
chapter
opens
with
a
flowery
description
of
his
ride
away
from
San
Francisco
and
through
the
surrounding
hills
You
might
expect
some
kind
of
flashback
but
no
Stevens
has
hit
the
road
and
he
ll
continue
hitting
it
for
two
years
straight
Understand
though
Stevens
isn
t
shy
about
his
own
opinion
He
assesses
the
attractiveness
of
every
woman
he
meets
He
analyzes
every
meal
and
guesthouse
in
microscopic
detail
He
recounts
whole
histories
and
cultural
traditions
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
then
decides
how
they
measure
up
to
the
standards
of
Western
Civilization
Because
he
s
riding
a
bicycle
Stevens
is
particularly
preoccupied
with
road
conditions
and
he
casually
judges
entire
regions
by
their
traversability
Stevens
has
unwavering
confidence
in
his
own
perspective
and
he
assumes
that
we
do
too
even
if
we
have
no
idea
who
he
is
From
a
literary
perspective
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
is
missing
vital
context
Take
a
similar
book
like
Cheryl
Strayed
s
Wild
and
you
ll
find
a
memoir
of
loss
and
addiction
that
also
happens
to
take
place
on
the
Pacific
Crest
Trail
The
most
respected
travelogues
are
usually
couched
in
introspection
Lands
of
Lost
Borders
by
Kate
Harris
is
also
about
a
cyclist
riding
thousands
of
miles
across
Asia
but
Harris
chronicles
much
of
her
life
story
up
to
that
point
in
order
to
explain
the
importance
of
her
journey
In
contrast
Stevens
unburdens
himself
of
any
past
or
motivation
There
s
nothing
to
him
He
could
be
any
able-bodied
Victorian
male
with
a
taste
for
adventure
The
most
revealing
passage
isn
t
in
the
story
itself
but
in
the
front
matter
To
Colonel
Albert
A
Pope
of
Boston
Massachusetts
whose
liberal
spirit
of
enterprise
and
generous
confidence
in
the
integrity
and
ability
of
the
author
made
the
tour
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
possible
by
unstinted
financial
patronage
is
this
volume
respectfully
dedicated
There
you
have
it
A
young
man
writes
his
first
book
and
he
dedicates
it
to
his
bankroller
Granted
Col
Pope
was
a
prominent
bicycle
manufacturer
at
the
time
Stevens
owned
a
bicycle
one
he
d
bought
with
his
own
money
for
an
1884
trip
across
the
United
States
but
Pope
gifted
him
a
nickel-plated
Columbia
Express
and
contracted
him
to
write
about
his
two-wheeled
travels
for
Outing
a
magazine
Pope
owned
Stevens
would
later
draw
on
those
articles
to
form
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
How
all
this
came
to
pass
though
would
be
anybody
s
guess
because
the
book
never
mentions
these
arrangements
nor
Pope
nor
anyone
Stevens
knows
or
cares
about
again
But
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
isn
t
literature
nor
does
it
have
any
ambitions
to
be
Stevens
may
be
the
first
human
to
circle
the
globe
on
a
bicycle
and
he
may
have
chronicled
the
minutiae
of
that
saga
but
Stevens
book
and
Strayed
s
Wild
don
t
stem
from
the
same
tradition
Wild
is
travel
writing
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
is
something
else
entirely
It
s
sports
porn
Let
s
get
one
thing
out
of
the
way
I
love
sports
porn
While
I
m
sure
there
is
sports
porn
intended
for
genuine
sexual
gratification
I
of
course
mean
something
more
colloquial
texts
and
images
that
excite
consumers
on
a
primal
level
This
more
wholesome
brand
of
sports
porn
celebrates
athletic
achievement
in
all
its
visual
glory
perhaps
motivating
the
consumer
to
attempt
similar
feats
but
offers
little
narrative
substance
Like
actual
pornography
sports
porn
doesn
t
tell
a
story
so
much
as
serve
up
an
exciting
scenario
What
if
you
biked
down
a
mountainous
Chilean
barrio
What
if
you
went
fly
fishing
in
the
remotest
rivers
of
Siberia
What
if
you
in
this
case
rode
your
high-wheeled
bicycle
all
the
way
around
the
planet
Specifically
I
love
outdoors
porn
and
bicycle
porn
in
particular
As
an
avid
rider
who
writes
regularly
about
cycling
I
could
watch
vloggers
pedal
over
the
Rockies
all
day
I
devour
whole
issues
of
Adventure
Cyclist
the
official
magazine
of
the
Adventure
Cycling
Association
and
every
last
field
report
I
attended
the
Banff
Mountain
Film
Festival
several
years
in
a
row
where
I
watched
film
after
film
of
adrenaline
junkies
BASE
jumping
off
cliffs
or
paddling
kayaks
over
waterfalls
Video
is
now
the
dominant
medium
for
sports
porn
which
makes
perfect
sense
Moving
pictures
require
little
explanation
and
can
literally
zoom
in
on
physical
action
This
is
the
kind
of
high-octane
excitement
that
GoPro
cameras
were
designed
for
Today
it
s
easy
for
weekend
warriors
to
shoot
at
high
frame-rates
and
incorporate
slo-mo
and
speed-ramps
into
their
videos
even
amateur
productions
can
look
spectacular
More
and
more
often
solo
sportsmen
can
make
masterpieces
on
their
own
Gravel
bikers
journey
into
the
Kyrgyzstani
wilderness
with
their
prosumer
drones
and
they
return
as
YouTube
influencers
with
thousands
or
even
millions
of
followers
Any
attempt
at
real
plot
would
ruin
the
mojo

But
before
video
there
were
glossy
magazines
like
Outside
Backpacker
and
Dirt
Rag
periodicals
that
are
often
described
in
the
journalism
industry
as
aspirational
I
cite
these
titles
lovingly
They
are
the
few
glossies
I
ve
ever
actually
subscribed
to
or
read
cover-to-cover
I
have
spent
much
of
my
own
career
writing
aspirational
articles
like
how
to
ride
a
bike
in
Taiwan
or
where
to
grab
brunch
in
Providence
But
while
magazines
like
Outside
publish
in-depth
profiles
about
serious
topics
their
appeal
for
many
is
largely
pictorial
Like
National
Geographic
s
stunning
landscape
panoramas
and
aerial
shots
sports
porn
photos
of
Himalayan
ice-climbers
and
trail-running
through
Scotland
will
knock
the
wind
out
of
you
The
next
thing

know
you

ordered
$
300

hired

personal

Before
moving
pictures
existed
though
Thomas
Stevens
was
stirring
imaginations
with
his
words
and
sports
porn
is
the
genre
he
helped
create
In
1886
the
high-wheel
bicycle
known
by
many
as
an
Ordinary
or
a
penny-farthing
a
reference
to
the
large
and
small
British
coins
its
wheels
resembled
was
roughly
equivalent
to
the
iPhone
in
2022
a
relatively
new
technology
that
had
completely
transformed
modern
society
Europeans
and
Americans
were
still
grasping
the
possibilities
of
this
magical
new
machine
and
Stevens
seized
the
moment
he
vowed
to
ride
across
the
United
States
England
Europe
the
Middle
East
and
Asia
completing
his
journey
in
Yokohama
Japan
The
route
was
arbitrary
as
all
round-the-world
tours
are
but
Stevens
is
still
the
first
known
cyclist
to
satisfy
the
public
with
this
claim
Stevens
pedaled
through
countries
he
knew
his
readers
would
never
visit
and
he
vividly
described
the
people
he
met
In
the
same
spirit
as
any
pornographic
text
readers
were
invited
to
switch
out
the
actual
narrator
for
their
own
globe-trotting
fantasy
Nobody
cared
who
Thomas
Stevens
was
What
they
wanted
to
know
was
how
he
did
it
and
what
it
was
like
when
he
got
there
To
be
fair
I
didn
t
read
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
so
much
as
listen
to
it
Vintage
copies
on
eBay
can
cost
hundreds
of
dollars
and
I
struggled
to
find
an
unabridged
reprint
An
inexpensive
ebook
version
was
easy
to
find
but
I
was
reluctant
to
read
1,000
pages
of
purple
prose
on
a
backlit
screen
Instead
I
found
a
recording
produced
by
LibriVox
a
free
archive
of
public
domain
writings
that
functions
like
a
Project
Gutenberg
of
audiobooks
and
I
dedicated
several
weeks
to
Stevens
book
which
is
read
in
tandem
by
several
volunteer
narrators
Stevens
was
only
the
latest
in
a
series
of
authors
whose
works
about
long-distance
bike
touring
I
ve
read
many
of
them
historical
I
had
devoured
a
book
by
Fred
A
Birchmore
also
called
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
about
the
author
s
journey
in
the
mid-1930s
I
had
read
Barbara
Savage
s
Far
From
Nowhere
about
a
round-the-world
bike
tour
with
her
husband
in
the
late
1970s
Most
interestingly
I
read
Around
the
World
on
Two
Wheels
by
Peter
Zheutlin
a
biography
of
Annie
Londonderry
and
her
infamous
wager
in
the
1890s
All
these
authors
followed
similar
routes
and
they
all
paid
homage
to
Stevens
Day
after
day
I
played
Stevens
book
on
my
car
stereo
On
the
bike
trail
earbud
affixed
I
gorged
on
chapters
The
book
echoed
in
my
kitchen
as
I
cooked
or
washed
dishes
much
to
my
family
s
chagrin
Travelogues
are
a
double
whammy
for
the
reader
because
the
geographic
journey
mirrors
the
progression
of
sentences
The
bike
wheel
turns
slowly
uphill
the
paper
page
turns
in
the
reader
s
fingers
the
MP3
s
time-stamp
ticks
along
second
by
second
As
that
journey
continued
I
found
myself
torn
On
the
one
hand
I
liked
Stevens
and
could
only
imagine
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
know
him
He
s
eloquent
dashing
and
good-humored
The
way
he
describes
himself
Stevens
seems
gracious
to
friends
and
brass-knuckled
to
antagonists
He
is
genuinely
curious
about
everything
he
sees
from
folk
dances
in
Eastern
Europe
to
dining
etiquette
in
Kurdistan
Stevens
takes
pains
to
learn
local
languages
to
make
friends
wherever
he
goes
He
compliments
and
admires
much
of
what
he
sees
His
awestruck
description
of
the
Taj
Mahal
is
tear-jerkingly
sincere
Like
all
great
travelers
the
man
takes
everything
in
stride
when
Stevens
is
arrested
in
Afghanistan
and
escorted
back
to
Persia
he
expresses
little
more
than
disappointment
As
the
golden
dome
of
Imam
Riza
s
sanctuary
glimmers
upon
my
retreating
figure
yet
a
fourth
time
as
I
reach
the
summit
of
the
hill
whence
we
first
beheld
it
he
writes
I
breathe
a
silent
hope
that
I
may
never
set
eyes
on
it
again
If
there
s
anything
a
cross-country
cyclist
loathes
it
s
backtracking
Yet
Stevens
was
a
product
of
his
era
He
places
absolute
faith
in
his
Anglo-Saxon
virtues
and
he
finds
novel
ways
to
trivialize
every
other
ethnicity
He
has
no
problem
describing
people
as
savages
and
comparing
their
behaviors
to
children
or
even
animals
In
one
passage
Stevens
is
forcibly
escorted
by
a
dark-skinned
soldier
in
the
Pashtun
hills
and
his
description
of
the
man
amounts
to
straight-up
minstrelsy
He
also
carries
a
revolver
which
was
common
at
the
time
but
he
brags
about
using
random
wildlife
for
target
practice
From
a
modern
viewpoint
Stevens
boorish
attitudes
remain
unsettling
to
the
very
last
page
Sports
porn
still
struggles
with
this
archetype
the
brave
white
male
seeking
glory
in
exotic
lands
In
fairness
I
have
seen
the
genre
diversify
in
recent
years
largely
thanks
to
social
media
but
the
go-to
lead
character
is
still
a
scruffy
blonde
guy
with
a
California
cadence
Outdoorsy
Americans
tend
to
have
conspicuous
freedom
and
safety
nets
that
make
their
lifestyles
possible
Nowhere
is
this
privilege
more
evident
than
in
their
rationales
often
spoken
in
voiceover
I
didn
t
want
to
spend
my
life
stuck
in
an
office
or
I
needed
to
push
myself
to
try
something
new
the
usual
declarations
of
young
men
with
a
granola
streak
and
nothing
more
pressing
to
worry
about
I
can
t
criticize
them
too
much
because
I
am
part
of
that
tribe
an
obsessive
cross-country
cyclist
who
spends
much
of
his
free
time
reading
about
far-flung
expeditions
by
bike
As
a
scruffy
white
guy
I
could
step
into
any
of
those
YouTube
fantasias
and
no
one
would
notice
Almost
90
years
after
Stevens
death
I
remain
his
target
readership
And
although
the
penny-farthing
was
soon
replaced
with
the
safety
bicycle
Stevens
and
I
use
roughly
the
same
vehicle
for
roughly
the
same
purpose
to
explore
to
challenge
ourselves
to
connect
with
the
world
In
Rhode
Island
s
entire
Ocean
State
Libraries
system
I
couldn
t
find
a
single
edition
of
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
in
print
or
digital
versions
Instead
I
tracked
down
a
copy
at
the
Providence
Athenaeum
a
library
so
historic
that
it
used
to
loan
books
to
Edgar
Allan
Poe
But
this
wasn
t
just
any
copy
The
Athenaeum
has
an
original
printing
of
Stevens
book
released
in
two
volumes
in
1887
and
1888
What
s
more
handwritten
notations
in
each
book
verify
that
the
volumes
were
acquired
in
July
and
September
of
their
respective
publication
years
These
copies
now
tattered
from
centuries
of
use
their
spines
chipped
and
cracked
were
hot
off
the
presses
when
they
joined
the
Athenaeum
s
collection
Photo

Robert
Isenberg
One
of
the
librarians
carefully
set
up
the
books
on
a
table
to
make
sure
I
didn
t
strain
the
covers
She
had
never
heard
of
Thomas
Stevens
and
when
she
saw
a
picture
of
the
author
in
the
opening
pages
she
guessed
he
was
riding
a
unicycle
She
sat
at
the
desk
behind
me
while
I
read
a
gesture
I
appreciated
Seeing
the
book
firsthand
was
a
euphoric
moment
and
I
was
grateful
for
someone
to
witness
it
What
I
hadn
t
realized
was
that
Stevens
book
was
illustrated
between
them
the
volumes
contained
180
black-and-white
plates
The
etchings
are
artful
and
detailed
I
could
frame
any
one
of
them
and
proudly
hang
it
in
my
home
As
a
drawn
character
Stevens
appears
again
and
again
riding
his
bicycle
or
standing
beside
it
he
finds
himself
in
wildly
mixed
company
fashions
change
all
around
him
from
top
hats
to
fezes
to
turbans
to
jingasa
It
s
hard
to
tell
how
much
the
artist
embellished
of
course
Stevens
carried
a
camera
and
he
mentions
snapping
pictures
but
he
also
rode
alone
and
there
was
no
Google
Images
search
to
verify
his
accounts
As
critical
as
I
am
of
Victorian
culture
I
couldn
t
help
but
fall
under
Stevens
spell
I
had
already
devoured
the
audiobook
yet
found
that
I
still
had
plenty
of
room
for
dessert
Sports
porn
is
most
effective
when
it
s
audacious
People
aren
t
supposed
to
have
fun
in
such
dangerous
ways
yet
here
they
are
free-climbing
up
sheer
sandstone
Stevens
didn
t
reveal
much
about
himself
but
he
loved
being
the
center
of
attention
The
front
wheel
of
his
penny-farthing
was
50
inches
tall
and
Stevens
coasted
into
villages
where
bicycles
had
never
been
seen
In
his
telling
Stevens
constantly
explains
what
the
bicycle
is
and
he
entertains
crowds
by
demonstrating
its
use
More
than
once
strangers
offer
to
buy
the
bike
from
him
Stevens
craved
the
attention
and
readers
were
eager
to
pay
it
For
a
21st-century
reader
like
me
the
real
value
of
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
is
accidental
It
freezes
time
Stevens
was
a
sportsman
and
tourist
he
saw
the
world
at
street
level
He
may
not
have
been
a
reliable
anthropologist
but
the
author
painstakingly
described
what
these
lands
looked
and
felt
like
to
an
ordinary
Western
visitor
Stevens
exhibits
a
mindfulness
that
modern
people
still
labor
to
attain
Given
enough
time
pornography
transforms
into
documentary
To
Stevens
writing
a
book
about
a
global
cycling
tour
was
a
business
op
with
a
built-in
publicity
stunt
Today
his
account
sheds
light
on
a
bygone
world
And
the
inspiration
remains
timeless
and
pure
unsullied
by
subtext
or
character
development
More
than
a
century
later
Stevens
still
urges
readers
onward
to
propel
ourselves
forward
to
see
how
far
we
can
go

guilty
pleasure
the
sugar
on
the
cereal
of
serious
thought
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
if
at
all
Starting
the
day
with
a
dose
of
doom
is
just
what
adults
do
Instead
of
hope
our
culture
keeps
delivering
new
ways
to
throw
its
hands
up
in
defeat
Prestige
TV
is
drowning
in
dystopias
showing
us
how
our
darkest
impulses
and
noblest
aspirations
will
all
turn
out
for
the
worst
Meanwhile
collective
dreams
of
saving
the
Earth
have
largely
made
way
for
individualist
fantasies
of
replacing
it
with
the
world
s
richest
men
putting
billions
into
immersive
simulations
and
interplanetary
escape
hatches
The
assumption
seems
to
be
that
this
world
s
already
a
lost
cause
so
we
might
as
well
replace
it
Lately
though
I
ve
been
trying
my
best
to
shake
that
mindset
If
we
re
going
to
face
up
to
the
seemingly
insurmountable
tasks
ahead
hope
isn
t
a
luxury
it
s
a
necessity
The
challenge
is
approaching
hope
in
a
way
that
feels
realistic
Easy
answers
can
be
as
dangerous
as
pure
defeatism
but
if
we
re
going
to
convince
ourselves
to
change
we
need
better
futures
to
aspire
to
not
just
worse
ones
to
avoid
I
ve
always
had
difficulty
imagining
a
better
world
In
high
school
tasked
with
a
group
project
to
design
the
political
economic
and
cultural
realities
of
a
future
paradise
our
four-person
team
split
into
two
irreconcilable
factions
with
my
partner
and
I
arguing
that
a
true
Utopia
was
simply
impossible
We
suggested
instead
a
Matrix-style
virtual
world
we
called
Inscience
from
the
Latin
for
lack
of
knowledge
where
everyone
would
at
least
have
the
illusion
of
happiness
It
was
a
cop-out
in
the
same
way
that
escaping
to
a
colony
on
Mars
is
a
cop-out
We
weren
t
engaging
with
the
actual
assignment
because
the
task
was
simply
too
big
Fortunately
there
are
others
who
are
more
up
to
the
job
than
our
teen
selves
were
Science
fiction
authors
who
challenge
themselves
to
move
beyond
cynicism
to
more
hopeful
and
genuinely
disruptive
futures
Ecologists
who
grapple
with
the
complexity
of
Earth
s
ecosystems
and
search
for
new
ways
to
embrace
that
complexity
rather
than
control
it
Writers
thinkers
and
activists
who
don
t
turn
away
from
the
peril
they
see
surrounding
us
but
who
also
refuse
to
let
that
be
all
they
see
The
late
Thích
Nhất
Hạnh
described
compassion
as
a
North
Star
writing
in
1987
s
Being
Peace
that
If
I
lose
my
direction
I
have
to
look
for
the
North
Star
and
I
go
to
the
north
That
does
not
mean
I
expect
to
arrive
at
the
North
Star
I
just
want
to
go
in
that
direction
Imagining
a
better
future
seems
to
work
the
same
way
It
isn
t
about
escaping
from
reality
it
s
about
finding
your
way
when
you
re
feeling
lost
The
inspiration
for
a
better
future
can
come
from
countless
sources
and
as
the
pieces
below
will
attest
whether
our
North
Star
is
fixed
in
a
firmament
of
scientific
fact
or
utopian
fiction
isn
t
what
s
important
After
all
following
it
doesn
t
give
us
license
to
ignore
the
terrain
we
re
walking
on
There
s
still
the
risk
that
we
ll
stumble
and
fall
but
at
least
we
can
point
ourselves
in
the
right
direction
One
of
the
grandest
gestures
toward
imagining
the
future
is
the
Clock
of
the
Long
Now
Originally
conceived
by
inventor
computer
scientist
and
Disney
Imagineering
fellow
Danny
Hillis
and
expected
to
cost
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
the
clock
is
designed
to
keep
time
for
10,000
years
Besides
being
a
tremendous
feat
of
engineering
it
s
also
a
tremendous
statement
of
faith
building
it
is
a
bet
that
there
will
be
humans
around
over
the
next
10
millennia
to
hear
its
bells
ring
Plenty
of
articles
have
talked
about
the
Clock
one
of
the
earliest
I
could
find
was
a
tangent
in
a
1997
New
Yorker
piece
on
the
futurist
visions
of
Imagineers
but
none
of
them
grappled
with
its
significance
quite
like
The
Future
Will
Have
to
Wait
As
much
as
it
describes
the
Clock
it
s
more
about
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
Long
Now
Foundation
to
encourage
humanity
to
think
on
longer
time
scales
and
the
powerful
emotions
that
can
emerge
just
from
imagining
our
survival
into
the
far
future
The
point
of
the
Clock
of
the
Long
Now
is
not
to
measure
out
the
passage
into
their
unknown
future
of
the
race
of
creatures
that
built
it
The
point
of
the
Clock
is
to
revive
and
restore
the
whole
idea
of
the
Future
to
get
us
thinking
about
the
Future
again
to
the
degree
if
not
in
quite
the
way
same
way
that
we
used
to
do
and
to
reintroduce
the
notion
that
we
don
t
just
bequeath
the
future—though
we
do
whether
we
think
about
it
or
not
We
also
in
the
very
broadest
sense
of
the
first
person
plural
pronoun
inherit
it
As
much
as
Chabon
s
thoughts
on
the
Clock
resonated
with
my
own
his
description
of
his
8-year-old
son
s
reaction
is
what
gives
the
piece
its
heart
It
s
a
reminder
that
the
stories
we
tell
genuinely
can
change
how
we
see
the
world
If
narratives
really
are
powerful
enough
to
shape
our
future
and
there
s
plenty
of
research
saying
that
they
are
then
we
should
probably
be
careful
about
the
stories
we
put
out
into
the
world
Not
that
there
isn
t
a
place
for
stories
about
our
darker
side
but
when
every
story
focuses
on
the
idea
that
we
re
one
disaster
away
from
the
collapse
of
civilization
it
doesn
t
give
much
to
aspire
to
Science
fiction
author
and
activist
Cory
Doctorow
describes
that
realization
in
this
2020
essay
written
as
part
of
Slate
s
Future
Tense
series
on
emerging
technology
public
policy
and
society
Reflecting
on
the
role
of
stories
in
shaping
our
mindset
he
brings
up
philosopher
Daniel
Dennett
s
idea
of
intuition
pumps
thought
experiments
designed
to
help
intuit
the
answers
to
complex
problems
Science
fiction
that
imagines
humanity
as
a
competitive
creature
hiding
beneath
a
veneer
of
cooperation
doesn
t
just
contradict
contemporary
research
into
humanity
s
origins
it
primes
our
pumps
with
exactly
the
wrong
intuitions
The
problem
is
it
s
wrong
It
makes
for
good
stories
but
those
stories
don
t
reflect
the
truth
of
the
world
as
I
see
it
Humanity
is
on
balance
good
We
have
done
remarkable
things
The
fact
that
we
remain
here
today
after
so
many
disasters
in
our
species
history
is
a
reminder
that
we
are
a
species
of
self-rescuing
princesses—characters
who
save
one
another
in
crisis
rather
than
turning
on
ourselves
Doctorow
goes
on
to
describe
how
that
insight
has
influenced
his
writing
and
it
s
fascinating
to
see
an
author
confront
the
cynicism
of
their
past
work
His
newer
stories
are
still
far
from
Utopian
but
by
putting
the
potential
for
change
at
their
heart
they
re
more
likely
to
inspire
progress
in
the
real
world
In
early
2022
Wired
released
a
collection
called
The
Future
of
Futures
that
could
easily
have
been
a
whole
reading
list
in
itself
Tempting
as
it
was
to
include
that
series
article
on
Tropical
Futurism
and
alternative
visions
of
tomorrow
it
was
edged
out
by
another
Wired
article
from
a
few
months
earlier
Jason
Kehe
s
profile
of
science
fiction
author
Becky
Chambers
To
describe
the
unique
mood
of
Chambers
brand
of
science
fiction
Kehe
keeps
returning
to
the
metaphor
of
a
pot
of
tea
Unlike
the
epic
space
operas
that
many
people
associate
with
sci-fi
her
stories
are
calming
complex
the
drink
of
choice
for
the
clear-headed
among
us
Her
writing
falls
into
a
genre
called
hopepunk
one
of
a
bouquet
of
alternatives
to
the
dourness
of
cyberpunk
that
have
begun
blooming
in
the
underground
sci-fi
landscape
For
Chambers
who
didn
t
ask
to
be
labeled
hopepunk
but
likes
the
term
very
much
the
simple
act
of
being
kind
in
her
writing
of
imagining
futures
in
which
decency
triumphs
and
people
are
allowed
to
cry
tears
of
joy
qualifies
as
more
than
sufficiently
rebellious
in
the
21st
century
You
re
looking
at
the
world
exactly
as
it
is
with
all
of
its
grimness
and
all
of
its
tragedy
and
you
say
No
I
believe
this
can
be
better
she
says
That
to
me
is
punk
as
hell
Although
Chambers
stories
aren
t
speculative
in
the
same
sense
as
writers
like
Doctorow
or
Kim
Stanley
Robinson
probably
the
most
prominent
name
in
contemporary
utopianism
that
doesn
t
detract
from
their
aspirational
power
Tea
leaves
may
not
be
the
most
scientifically
sound
way
to
look
at
the
future
but
that
doesn
t
stop
them
from
firing
some
imaginations
Coincidentally
taking
its
title
from
an
album
by
Long
Now
Foundation
co-founder
and
music
icon
Brian
Eno
Jessica
Camille
Aguirre
s
profile
of
amateur
scientist
Kai
Staats
lives
right
on
the
border
between
science
fiction
and
science
fact
Staats
goal
is
real
enough
the
self-contained
biome
he
s
designing
is
a
descendent
of
the
Biosphere
2
project
and
a
hopeful
predecessor
to
a
colony
on
Mars
but
whether
a
system
as
complex
and
chaotic
as
our
ecosystem
can
really
be
condensed
into
a
single
space
capsule
is
still
an
open
question
Like
Chabon
s
piece
on
the
Clock
of
the
Long
Now
though
Aguirre
isn
t
just
writing
about
a
single
project
It
s
about
the
challenges
of
space
exploration
but
it
s
also
about
what
the
desire
for
exploration
says
about
us
as
a
species
and
why
some
people
feel
such
a
visceral
compulsion
to
leave
the
planet
and
found
a
new
home
for
humanity
And
even
if
that
proves
impossible
it
s
also
about
how
the
project
s
complexity
helps
create
a
new
appreciation
for
Earth
and
just
how
miraculous
the
original
Biosphere
really
is
I
thought
about
a
conversation
I
had
months
before
with
Francesc
Godia
Casablancas
a
chemical
engineer
who
runs
the
ESA
s
pilot
plant
in
Barcelona
one
of
the
most
complex
biological
life-support
systems
ever
developed
He
told
me
that
no
matter
what
his
systems
would
always
lose
efficiency
over
time
the
simplified
biological
cycle
built
by
scientists
in
a
series
of
reactors
would
never
be
a
perfect
world
Living
on
a
planet
that
still
harbors
secrets
seemed
to
me
like
the
opposite
of
being
alone
There
is
a
strange
kind
of
companionship
in
the
tension
of
not
knowing
in
the
fact
that
the
systems
supporting
life
on
Earth
operate
beyond
our
control
Next
to
the
big
bold
future
of
interplanetary
travel
a
more
efficient
landfill
may
seem
like
an
excessively
modest
goal
But
pound
for
pound
the
ground-level
optimism
that
Andrea
McGuire
brings
to
her
profile
of
Newfoundland-based
startup
3F
Waste
Recovery
is
as
restorative
as
anything
you
ll
read
this
year
Connecting
the
company
s
circular
economics
equally
to
Canadian
East
Coast
salvage
culture
and
author
Neal
Stephenson
s
futuristic
technologies
she
subtly
makes
the
case
that
building
a
better
world
might
be
less
reliant
on
new
technologies
than
new
mindsets
Sci-fi
often
paints
the
future
as
an
increasingly
virtual
dystopia
But
a
book
like
[
Neal
Stephenson
s
]
The
Diamond
Age
pulses
with
inventive
possibilities
that
could
lead
to
more
grounded
ecologically
sound
possibilities
too
For
Wiper
the
sparsely
populated
Northern
Peninsula
is
the
best
place
to
nurture
his
utopic
sci-fi–inspired
ideals
Here
he
and
his
team
are
less
shackled
less
constrained
than
they
d
be
in
a
denser
more
centralized
region
he
says
There
s
plenty
of
space
for
experimenting—which
is
an
important
consideration
since
as
Lynch
tells
me
experimentation
is
absolutely
crucial
for
the
circular
economy
The
idea
of
fusing
future
thinking
and
traditional
knowledge
is
taken
even
further
in
Low-tech
Magazine
s
Obsolete
Technology
series
which
looks
to
seemingly
outdated
processes
like
using
urban
fish
ponds
for
sewage
processing
or
the
revolutionary
potential
of
the
hot
water
bottle
It
s
a
circular
spin
on
William
Gibson
s
oft-quoted
line
about
the
future
s
uneven
distribution
Sometimes
the
future
is
actually
in
the
past
It
s
nearly
impossible
to
talk
about
better
futures
without
bringing
up
Kim
Stanley
Robinson
Dubbed
the
gold-standard
of
realistic
and
highly
literary
science-fiction
writing
by
The
Atlantic
the
author
of
the
iconic
Mars
trilogy
has
used
his
novels
to
explore
topics
from
climate
change
and
environmentalism
to
post-capitalist
economics
with
a
hard-won
hopefulness
and
it
seems
fitting
to
give
him
the
last
word
Robinson
s
2018
essay
for
Commune
is
ostensibly
about
dystopian
writing
but
as
with
Doctorow
s
article
above
it
s
really
a
call
to
put
our
collective
imagination
to
better
use
We
have
the
raw
materials
for
a
better
future
a
planet
that
is
more
than
capable
of
sustaining
us
a
sun
that
provides
ample
energy
and
the
ability
to
think
creatively
about
how
to
build
a
sustainable
civilization
Worrying
can
only
take
us
so
far
especially
in
our
imagined
worlds
It
s
time
to
do
the
work
of
hope
Or
maybe
we
should
just
give
up
entirely
on
optimism
or
pessimism—we
have
to
do
this
work
no
matter
how
we
feel
about
it
So
by
force
of
will
or
the
sheer
default
of
emergency
we
make
ourselves
have
utopian
thoughts
and
ideas
This
is
the
necessary
next
step
following
the
dystopian
moment
without
which
dystopia
is
stuck
at
a
level
of
political
quietism
that
can
make
it
just
another
tool
of
control
and
of
things-as-they-are
The
situation
is
bad
yes
okay
enough
of
that
we
know
that
already
Dystopia
has
done
its
job
it
s
old
news
now
perhaps
it
s
self-indulgence
to
stay
stuck
in
that
place
any
more
Next
thought
utopia
Realistic
or
not
and
perhaps
especially
if
not

In

Astra
and
Sunaura
Taylor
make
a
socialist
feminist
case
for
veganism
which
can
open

help

be
part

the

shift
that

happen

create
a
more
egalitarian

Capitalism
is
about
controlling
bodies
they
write
not
just
of
humans
but
of
nonhuman
animals
like
cows
and
pigs
While
the
trauma
inflicted
on

the

it
is
interconnected
We
are
all
caught
in
the
same

ecologically
catastrophic
capitalist
system
This
is
a
call
for
cross-species
solidarity
and
to
consider
veganism
alongside
other
social
justice
movements
on
the
left
It
s

freely
admits
For

more
than

the

Boutique
delivers
a
blissful
calming

of

However
his
bias

owners
the
Pristines

originally
immigrants
from

ungainly
street

desperate

fix
It
s
a

story
of
a
business
that
thrived
even
during
the
pandemic
by
starting
virtual
cheese-making
classes
and
adding
a
food
truck
yet
kept
its
family
roots
Even
though
the
shop
attracts
fancy
customers
Dustin
Hoffman
is

visitor
and

prices
two
generations
of
Pristines
are
still
there
seven

descriptions
You

it

to

temp
slice
off
the
top
rind
and
spoon
out
the
gooey
inside

is

Anti-abortion
advocates
seeking
to
overturn
Roe
v
Wade
would
have
you
think
that
the
practice
of
terminating
pregnancies
is
a
new
phenomenon
brought
on
by
the
rise
of
feminism
and
the
imaginary
moral
decay
of
America
As
Tamara
Dean
lays
bare
in
this
essay
this
is
nothing
short
of
a
lie
Surveying
historical
literature
and
using
Nancy
Ann
Harris
a
woman
who
died
in
1876
in
a
rural
Wisconsin
county
as
a
lens
into
the
past
Dean
shows
how
abortion
was
a
legally
and
morally
acceptable
way
for
a
woman
to
care
for
her
health
until
misogynistic
racist
forces
decided
it
shouldn
t
be
Every
woman
including
Nancy
would
have
known
friends
sisters
or
cousins
who
died
or
were
debilitated
while
giving
birth
Dean
writes
They
would
have
known
those
who
took

I
was

in
Nigeria
Estimates
vary
but
thousands
of
native
Nigerians
have
taken
up
the
faith
in
the
past
few
decades
drifting
first
to
messianic
Christianity
and
then
to
full
Old-Testament
sidelocks-and-prayer-shawl
orthodoxy
There
s
a
sense
of
cultural
commonality
in
there
for
sure
most
Nigerian
Jews
are
of
the
Igbo
people
and
attribute
the
surprising
amount
of
ritual
overlap
to
a
lineage
descended
from
the
tribe
of
Gad
but
in
their
internet-enabled
assimilation
of
conventional
Judaism
adding
the
sanctioned
to

syncretic

are

I

suggest
that
if

can
change
words
on
a
page
they
might
also
change
their
lives
Had
Tsarnaev
been
a
student
in
my
class
I
might
have
encouraged
him
to
write
about
his
experiences
as
an
immigrant
or
what
drew
him
to
want
to
study
sea
life…Those
most
likely
to
tell
the
truth
about
their
lives
are
the
ones
with
nothing
left
to
lose…Unfortunately
you
can
t
escape
an
ideology
by
hoping
it
changes
You
end
up
becoming
it
instead…In

there
in
the
background
rising
and
then
falling
I
did
not
think
to
worry
or
wonder
or
wait
for
the
places
I
call
home
to
sink
Now
as
I
have
grown
older
and
the
water
has
grown
closer
and
higher
I
worry
I
pore
over
statistics
about
how
long
these
places
have
imagining
life
without
them
Every
time
I
am
home
and
I
walk
along
the
wall
that
holds
the
coastline
below
I
wonder
how
long
it
will
be
before
this
path
is
gone
before
this
street
is
gone
Before
this
whole
place
is
gone
and
me
with
it
Because
whether
I
like
it
or
not
there
will
come
a
day
where
we
will
not
be
able
to
hold
the
water
out
It
might
be
in
20
years
or
it
might
be
in
80
but
it
is
inevitable
How
do
you
cope
with
that
reality
How
do
you
love
a
place
that
is
sinking
I
spent
my
entire
life
waiting
to
leave
the
South
thinking
I
would
only
find
happiness
away
from
here
but
now
that
it
is
disappearing
I
find
I
can
not
look
away
I
am
desperate
to
find
ways
to
archive
my
home
To
preserve
it
To
create
a
memory
of
a
place
that
can
last
beyond
it
a
memorial
of
sorts
I
suppose
But
that
memorial
does
not
have
to
overcome
it
can
not
and
should
not
be
the
only
story
we
tell
ourselves
even
in
the
midst
of
it
There
can
still
be
celebration
appreciation
and
hope
existing
at
the
same
time
There
is
of
course
pain
in
these
places
dark
histories
and
troubled
waters
but
there
is
newfound
joy
too
There
is
love
and
hope
and
a
belief
in
resurrection
being
poured
into
the
modern
South
by
the
artists
writers
musicians
documentarians
and
individuals
who
call
it
home
It
is
beautiful
and
it
is
redemptive
These
stories
show
that
force
they
are
at
once
both
love
letters
and
critiques
memorials
and
memories
creating
an
archive
of
a
common
place
This
story
from
Lauren
Groff
about
a
climate
refugee
and
the
aftermath
of
a
wave
that
wipes
out
a
whole
coastline
in
minutes
is
beautifully
done
Groff
has
written
candidly
about
her
home
state
of
Florida
but
this
story
speaks
in
descriptive
prose
about
an
experience
bound
to
become
more
frequent
as
natural
disasters
increase
The
Bitter
Southerner
is
one
of
the
best
publications
right
now
truly
Much
of
their
journalism
focuses
on
climate
and
nature
in
the
modern
South
I
love
this
piece
from
Boyce
Upholt
about
the
largest
river
swamp
in
the
United
States
which
is
slowly
sinking
He
poses
a
great
question
that
I
find
especially
relevant
for
today
s
South
How
do
you
preserve
a
landscape
when
the
only
constant
is
change
The
Atchafalaya
Basin
in
Louisiana
is
a
floodway
that
protects
the
entire
South
from
rising
water
levels
In
this
piece
Upholt
reflects
on
the
history
of
the
swamp
the
mythology
of
the
region
and
learning
to
live
with
change
a
lesson
especially
important
as
time
goes
on
As
he
says
Belle
Boggs
writes
about
how
we
tell
stories
about
our
world
especially
in
regard
to
how
we
process
a
changing
climate
Through
a
reflection
on
parenthood
and
raising
her
daughter
in
rural
North
Carolina
she
looks
at
our
communal
role
as
unreliable
narrators
who
want
to
be
both
honest
and
optimistic
about
where
our
future
with
climate
change
stands
She
also
examines
the
education
system
and
the
ways
we
teach
climate
change
in
the
rural
South
if
we
teach
it
at
all
I
appreciate
and
agree
with
Boggs
view
that
one
of
our
roles
as
artists
is
to
become
documentarians
chronicling
this
specific
moment
in
time
Art
movements
such
as
The
Dark
Mountain
Project
often
discuss
how
our
art
must
begin
to
engage
with
the
new
world
around
us
rather
than
living
in
a
fictional
past
and
I
think
Boggs
does
a
great
job
of
showing
that
intersection
of
documentation
reflection
and
cautionary
hope
in
this
piece
In
moments
of
crisis
art
is
a
force
that
can
help
us
process
When
we
can
not
find
the
words
ourselves
we
turn
to
the
words
of
others
whether
those
be
in
music
poetry
fiction
or
film
For
Scalawag
Sergio
Lopez
reflects
on
the
history
of
music
in
response
to
coastal
flooding
tracing
it
back
to
the
Great
Flood
of
1927
that
washed
out
the
Mississippi
and
the
Black
musicians
who
poured
out
music
testifying
to
the
destruction
Then
and
now
music
has
helped
us
to
bear
witness
and
from
that
to
ask
for
change
But
Lopez
also
warns
of
the
consequences
of
separating
these
songs
which
he
compiles
in
a
playlist
including
everything
from
Eric
Clapton
to
Lil
Wayne
to
Charley
Patton
to
Led
Zeppelin
from
their
historical
and
intended
meaning

Writer
Meghan
Mayhew
Bergman
reflects
for
The
Guardian
on
the
disappearing
highways
in
her
childhood
home
of
coastal
North
Carolina
As
she
drove
along
Highway
12
a
road
along
the
Carolina
coast
s
barrier
islands
she
ruminated
on
change
and
the
inevitably
of
it
There
is
a
precarity
to
loving
places
that
we
know
will
disappear
a
tenacious
joy
in
finding
home
in
what
we
are
bound
to
lose
It
has
been
one
of
the
core
facets
of
my
own
Southern
journey
as
I
grew
up
here
left
and
returned
only
to
learn
what
I
returned
to
could
never
last
Beyond
climate
coastal
towns
thrive
on
tourism
and
in
turn
have
suffered
the
effects
of
rampant
gentrification
the
places
I
once
used
to
find
familiar
are
at
best
changed
and
at
worst
gone
The
main
theme
I
have
found
in
all
the
writing
of
the
coastal
South
I
have
pored
over
the
last
few
years
is
that
change
is
inevitable
Whether
in
the
form
of
climate
disasters
rising
floodwaters
or
small
towns
falling
to
development
projects
it
will
come
The
point
to
stop
it
is
long
past
us
What
is
important
now
is
how
we
learn
to
live
with
it
how
we
learn
to
make
homes
in
all
of
this
ruin
How
we
can
even
learn
to
love
them
Delilah

at
Louisiana
and
the
Gulf
Coast
as
a
test
ground
for
a
Civilian
Climate
Corps
a
program
being
debated
in
Congress
Similar
to
Roosevelt

Corps
a

natural

in
the
wake
of
hurricanes
hitting
the
Gulf

season
after
season
a
process
failing
everyone
but
especially
families
of
color
So
much
of
our
work
with
climate
in
the
South
is
related
to
memory
what
we
remember
now
and
what
we
will
remember
when
the
waters
rise
when
the
fires
burn
when
the

on
her
relationship
with
her
father
Appalachia
coastal
Florida
and
their
varying
approaches
to
climate
safety
in
this
beautiful
story
One
morning
this
summer
I
heard
the
news
about
a
hurricane
coming
up
the
gulf
coast
I
asked
my
father
as
usual
if
he
would
evacuate
He
said
he
wouldn
t
that
he
was
ready
for
the
rain
He
wrote
back
to
me
like
some
kind
of
solem
prophet
For
me
water
is
everything
needful
yet
hiding
the
wrath
of
God
Quench
my
thirst
yet
I
can
drown
in
2
teaspoons
full
cleanse
my
body
there
could
be
a
deadly
virus
lurking
Leap
or
dive
into
the
sudden
cold
embrace
and
smash
my
spine
or
head
on
a
rock
the
undertow
the
river
current
the
giant
wave
the
hurricane
all
can
take
me
away
He
speaks
about

in
a
holy
language

I
am
bowling
along
beneath
overhanging
peach
and
mulberry
trees
recalls
Thomas
Stevens
in
the
19th
chapter
of
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
following
a
volunteer
horseman
to
Mohammed
Ali
Khan
s
garden
Before
reaching
the
garden
a
gang
of
bare-legged
laborers
engaged
in
patching
up
a
mud
wall
favor
me
with
a
fusillade
of
stones
one
of
which
caresses
my
ankle
and
makes
me
limp
like
a
Greenwich
pensioner
when
I
dismount
a
minute
or
two
afterward…
Like
many
travel
writers
Thomas
Stevens
wrote
in
the
first
person
He
also
wrote
in
the
present
tense
so
everything
he
recounts
feels
immediate
as
if
his
journey
is
unfolding
in
real
time
Over
the
course
of
many
hundreds
of
pages
the
reader
travels
with
Stevens
eats
with
Stevens
weathers
rainstorms
with
Stevens
When
Stevens
outwits
thieves
in
Persia
we
re
right
there
with
him
When
he
listens
to
Hungarian
Gypsy
music
in
Serbia
we
hear
it
too
When
he
narrowly
evades
a
herd
of
stampeding
mustangs
in
the
American
frontier
we
also
duck
and
cover
With
every
crank
of
his
pedal
we
ride
alongside
absorbing
the
same
sensations
But
there
s
one
thing
missing
from
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
Stevens
mammoth
memoir
from
1887
the
author
himself
Nowhere
in
his
two
volumes
and
41
chapters
does
Stevens
bother
to
explain
why
he
decided
to
ride
a
penny-farthing
across
three
continents
He
never
once
mentions
his
parents
his
childhood
or
a
prior
career
Even
his
titular
bicycle
which
carries
him
13,500
miles
over
mountains
and
deserts
has
no
origin
story
it
simply
appears
out
of
the
ether
The
first
chapter
opens
with
a
flowery
description
of
his
ride
away
from
San
Francisco
and
through
the
surrounding
hills
You
might
expect
some
kind
of
flashback
but
no
Stevens
has
hit
the
road
and
he
ll
continue
hitting
it
for
two
years
straight
Understand
though
Stevens
isn
t
shy
about
his
own
opinion
He
assesses
the
attractiveness
of
every
woman
he
meets
He
analyzes
every
meal
and
guesthouse
in
microscopic
detail
He
recounts
whole
histories
and
cultural
traditions
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
then
decides
how
they
measure
up
to
the
standards
of
Western
Civilization
Because
he
s
riding
a
bicycle
Stevens
is
particularly
preoccupied
with
road
conditions
and
he
casually
judges
entire
regions
by
their
traversability
Stevens
has
unwavering
confidence
in
his
own
perspective
and
he
assumes
that
we
do
too
even
if
we
have
no
idea
who
he
is
From
a
literary
perspective
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
is
missing
vital
context
Take
a
similar
book
like
Cheryl
Strayed
s
Wild
and
you
ll
find
a
memoir
of
loss
and
addiction
that
also
happens
to
take
place
on
the
Pacific
Crest
Trail
The
most
respected
travelogues
are
usually
couched
in
introspection
Lands
of
Lost
Borders
by
Kate
Harris
is
also
about
a
cyclist
riding
thousands
of
miles
across
Asia
but
Harris
chronicles
much
of
her
life
story
up
to
that
point
in
order
to
explain
the
importance
of
her
journey
In
contrast
Stevens
unburdens
himself
of
any
past
or
motivation
There
s
nothing
to
him
He
could
be
any
able-bodied
Victorian
male
with
a
taste
for
adventure
The
most
revealing
passage
isn
t
in
the
story
itself
but
in
the
front
matter
To
Colonel
Albert
A
Pope
of
Boston
Massachusetts
whose
liberal
spirit
of
enterprise
and
generous
confidence
in
the
integrity
and
ability
of
the
author
made
the
tour
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
possible
by
unstinted
financial
patronage
is
this
volume
respectfully
dedicated
There
you
have
it
A
young
man
writes
his
first
book
and
he
dedicates
it
to
his
bankroller
Granted
Col
Pope
was
a
prominent
bicycle
manufacturer
at
the
time
Stevens
owned
a
bicycle
one
he
d
bought
with
his
own
money
for
an
1884
trip
across
the
United
States
but
Pope
gifted
him
a
nickel-plated
Columbia
Express
and
contracted
him
to
write
about
his
two-wheeled
travels
for
Outing
a
magazine
Pope
owned
Stevens
would
later
draw
on
those
articles
to
form
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
How
all
this
came
to
pass
though
would
be
anybody
s
guess
because
the
book
never
mentions
these
arrangements
nor
Pope
nor
anyone
Stevens
knows
or
cares
about
again
But
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
isn
t
literature
nor
does
it
have
any
ambitions
to
be
Stevens
may
be
the
first
human
to
circle
the
globe
on
a
bicycle
and
he
may
have
chronicled
the
minutiae
of
that
saga
but
Stevens
book
and
Strayed
s
Wild
don
t
stem
from
the
same
tradition
Wild
is
travel
writing
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
is
something
else
entirely
It
s
sports
porn
Let
s
get
one
thing
out
of
the
way
I
love
sports
porn
While
I
m
sure
there
is
sports
porn
intended
for
genuine
sexual
gratification
I
of
course
mean
something
more
colloquial
texts
and
images
that
excite
consumers
on
a
primal
level
This
more
wholesome
brand
of
sports
porn
celebrates
athletic
achievement
in
all
its
visual
glory
perhaps
motivating
the
consumer
to
attempt
similar
feats
but
offers
little
narrative
substance
Like
actual
pornography
sports
porn
doesn
t
tell
a
story
so
much
as
serve
up
an
exciting
scenario
What
if
you
biked
down
a
mountainous
Chilean
barrio
What
if
you
went
fly
fishing
in
the
remotest
rivers
of
Siberia
What
if
you
in
this
case
rode
your
high-wheeled
bicycle
all
the
way
around
the
planet
Specifically
I
love
outdoors
porn
and
bicycle
porn
in
particular
As
an
avid
rider
who
writes
regularly
about
cycling
I
could
watch
vloggers
pedal
over
the
Rockies
all
day
I
devour
whole
issues
of
Adventure
Cyclist
the
official
magazine
of
the
Adventure
Cycling
Association
and
every
last
field
report
I
attended
the
Banff
Mountain
Film
Festival
several
years
in
a
row
where
I
watched
film
after
film
of
adrenaline
junkies
BASE
jumping
off
cliffs
or
paddling
kayaks
over
waterfalls
Video
is
now
the
dominant
medium
for
sports
porn
which
makes
perfect
sense
Moving
pictures
require
little
explanation
and
can
literally
zoom
in
on
physical
action
This
is
the
kind
of
high-octane
excitement
that
GoPro
cameras
were
designed
for
Today
it
s
easy
for
weekend
warriors
to
shoot
at
high
frame-rates
and
incorporate
slo-mo
and
speed-ramps
into
their
videos
even
amateur
productions
can
look
spectacular
More
and
more
often
solo
sportsmen
can
make
masterpieces
on
their
own
Gravel
bikers
journey
into
the
Kyrgyzstani
wilderness
with
their
prosumer
drones
and
they
return
as
YouTube
influencers
with
thousands
or
even
millions
of
followers
Any
attempt
at
real
plot
would
ruin
the
mojo

I
have
spent
much
of
my
own
career
writing
aspirational
articles
like
how
to
ride
a
bike
in
Taiwan
or
where
to
grab
brunch
in
Providence
But
while
magazines
like
Outside
publish
in-depth
profiles
about
serious
topics
their
appeal
for
many
is
largely
pictorial
Like
National
Geographic
s
stunning
landscape
panoramas
and
aerial
shots
sports
porn
photos
of
Himalayan
ice-climbers
and
trail-running
through
Scotland
will
knock
the
wind
out
of
you
The
next
thing
you
know
you
ve
ordered
$
300
worth
of
gear
from
REI
and
hired
a
personal
trainer
Before
moving
pictures
existed
though
Thomas
Stevens
was
stirring
imaginations
with
his
words
and
sports
porn
is
the
genre
he
helped
create
In
1886
the
high-wheel
bicycle
known
by
many
as
an
Ordinary
or
a
penny-farthing
a
reference
to
the
large
and
small
British
coins
its
wheels
resembled
was
roughly
equivalent
to
the
iPhone
in
2022
a
relatively
new
technology
that
had
completely
transformed
modern
society
Europeans
and
Americans
were
still
grasping
the
possibilities
of
this
magical
new
machine
and
Stevens
seized
the
moment
he
vowed
to
ride
across
the
United
States
England
Europe
the
Middle
East
and
Asia
completing
his
journey
in
Yokohama
Japan
The
route
was
arbitrary
as
all
round-the-world
tours
are
but
Stevens
is
still
the
first
known
cyclist
to
satisfy
the
public
with
this
claim
Stevens
pedaled
through
countries
he
knew
his
readers
would
never
visit
and
he
vividly
described
the
people
he
met
In
the
same
spirit
as
any
pornographic
text
readers
were
invited
to
switch
out
the
actual
narrator
for
their
own
globe-trotting
fantasy
Nobody
cared
who
Thomas
Stevens
was
What
they
wanted
to
know
was
how
he
did
it
and
what
it
was
like
when
he
got
there
To
be
fair
I
didn
t
read
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
so
much
as
listen
to
it
Vintage
copies
on
eBay
can
cost
hundreds
of
dollars
and
I
struggled
to
find
an
unabridged
reprint
An
inexpensive
ebook
version
was
easy
to
find
but
I
was
reluctant
to
read
1,000
pages
of
purple
prose
on
a
backlit
screen
Instead
I
found
a
recording
produced
by
LibriVox
a
free
archive
of
public
domain
writings
that
functions
like
a
Project
Gutenberg
of
audiobooks
and
I
dedicated
several
weeks
to
Stevens
book
which
is
read
in
tandem
by
several
volunteer
narrators
Stevens
was
only
the
latest
in
a
series
of
authors
whose
works
about
long-distance
bike
touring
I
ve
read
many
of
them
historical
I
had
devoured
a
book
by
Fred
A
Birchmore
also
called
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
about
the
author
s
journey
in
the
mid-1930s
I
had
read
Barbara
Savage
s
Far
From
Nowhere
about
a
round-the-world
bike
tour
with
her
husband
in
the
late
1970s
Most
interestingly
I
read
Around
the
World
on
Two
Wheels
by
Peter
Zheutlin
a
biography
of
Annie
Londonderry
and
her
infamous
wager
in
the
1890s
All
these
authors
followed
similar
routes
and
they
all
paid
homage
to
Stevens
Day
after
day
I
played
Stevens
book
on
my
car
stereo
On
the
bike
trail
earbud
affixed
I
gorged
on
chapters
The
book
echoed
in
my
kitchen
as
I
cooked
or
washed
dishes
much
to
my
family
s
chagrin
Travelogues
are
a
double
whammy
for
the
reader
because
the
geographic
journey
mirrors
the
progression
of
sentences
The
bike
wheel
turns
slowly
uphill
the
paper
page
turns
in
the
reader
s
fingers
the
MP3
s
time-stamp
ticks
along
second
by
second
As
that
journey
continued
I
found
myself
torn
On
the
one
hand
I
liked
Stevens
and
could
only
imagine
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
know
him
He
s
eloquent
dashing
and
good-humored
The
way
he
describes
himself
Stevens
seems
gracious
to
friends
and
brass-knuckled
to
antagonists
He
is
genuinely
curious
about
everything
he
sees
from
folk
dances
in
Eastern
Europe
to
dining
etiquette
in
Kurdistan
Stevens
takes
pains
to
learn
local
languages
to
make
friends
wherever
he
goes
He
compliments
and
admires
much
of
what
he
sees
His
awestruck
description
of
the
Taj
Mahal
is
tear-jerkingly
sincere
Like
all
great
travelers
the
man
takes
everything
in
stride
when
Stevens
is
arrested
in
Afghanistan
and
escorted
back
to
Persia
he
expresses
little
more
than
disappointment
As
the
golden
dome
of
Imam
Riza
s
sanctuary
glimmers
upon
my
retreating
figure
yet
a
fourth
time
as
I
reach
the
summit
of
the
hill
whence
we
first
beheld
it
he
writes
I
breathe
a
silent
hope
that
I
may
never
set
eyes
on
it
again
If
there
s
anything
a
cross-country
cyclist
loathes
it
s
backtracking
Yet
Stevens
was
a
product
of
his
era
He
places
absolute
faith
in
his
Anglo-Saxon
virtues
and
he
finds
novel
ways
to
trivialize
every
other
ethnicity
He
has
no
problem
describing
people
as
savages
and
comparing
their
behaviors
to
children
or
even
animals
In
one
passage
Stevens
is
forcibly
escorted
by
a
dark-skinned
soldier
in
the
Pashtun
hills
and
his
description
of
the
man
amounts
to
straight-up
minstrelsy
He
also
carries
a
revolver
which
was
common
at
the
time
but
he
brags
about
using
random
wildlife
for
target
practice
From
a
modern
viewpoint
Stevens
boorish
attitudes
remain
unsettling
to
the
very
last
page
Sports
porn
still
struggles
with
this
archetype
the
brave
white
male
seeking
glory
in
exotic
lands
In
fairness
I
have
seen
the
genre
diversify
in
recent
years
largely
thanks
to
social
media
but
the
go-to
lead
character
is
still
a
scruffy
blonde
guy
with
a
California
cadence
Outdoorsy
Americans
tend
to
have
conspicuous
freedom
and
safety
nets
that
make
their
lifestyles
possible
Nowhere
is
this
privilege
more
evident
than
in
their
rationales
often
spoken
in
voiceover
I
didn
t
want
to
spend
my
life
stuck
in
an
office
or
I
needed
to
push
myself
to
try
something
new
the
usual
declarations
of
young
men
with
a
granola
streak
and
nothing
more
pressing
to
worry
about
I
can
t
criticize
them
too
much
because
I
am
part
of
that
tribe
an
obsessive
cross-country
cyclist
who
spends
much
of
his
free
time
reading
about
far-flung
expeditions
by
bike
As
a
scruffy
white
guy
I
could
step
into
any
of
those
YouTube
fantasias
and
no
one
would
notice
Almost
90
years
after
Stevens
death
I
remain
his
target
readership
And
although
the
penny-farthing
was
soon
replaced
with
the
safety
bicycle
Stevens
and
I
use
roughly
the
same
vehicle
for
roughly
the
same
purpose
to
explore
to
challenge
ourselves
to
connect
with
the
world
In
Rhode
Island
s
entire
Ocean
State
Libraries
system
I
couldn
t
find
a
single
edition
of
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
in
print
or
digital
versions
Instead
I
tracked
down
a
copy
at
the
Providence
Athenaeum
a
library
so
historic
that
it
used
to
loan
books
to
Edgar
Allan
Poe
But
this
wasn
t
just
any
copy
The
Athenaeum
has
an
original
printing
of
Stevens
book
released
in
two
volumes
in
1887
and
1888
What
s
more
handwritten
notations
in
each
book
verify
that
the
volumes
were
acquired
in
July
and
September
of
their
respective
publication
years
These
copies
now
tattered
from
centuries
of
use
their
spines
chipped
and
cracked
were
hot
off
the
presses
when
they
joined
the
Athenaeum
s
collection
Photo

Robert
Isenberg
One
of
the
librarians
carefully
set
up
the
books
on
a
table
to
make
sure
I
didn
t
strain
the
covers
She
had
never
heard
of
Thomas
Stevens
and
when
she
saw
a
picture
of
the
author
in
the
opening
pages
she
guessed
he
was
riding
a
unicycle
She
sat
at
the
desk
behind
me
while
I
read
a
gesture
I
appreciated
Seeing
the
book
firsthand
was
a
euphoric
moment
and
I
was
grateful
for
someone
to
witness
it
What
I
hadn
t
realized
was
that
Stevens
book
was
illustrated
between
them
the
volumes
contained
180
black-and-white
plates
The
etchings
are
artful
and
detailed
I
could
frame
any
one
of
them
and
proudly
hang
it
in
my
home
As
a
drawn
character
Stevens
appears
again
and
again
riding
his
bicycle
or
standing
beside
it
he
finds
himself
in
wildly
mixed
company
fashions
change
all
around
him
from
top
hats
to
fezes
to
turbans
to
jingasa
It
s
hard
to
tell
how
much
the
artist
embellished
of
course
Stevens
carried
a
camera
and
he
mentions
snapping
pictures
but
he
also
rode
alone
and
there
was
no
Google
Images
search
to
verify
his
accounts
As
critical
as
I
am
of
Victorian
culture
I
couldn
t
help
but
fall
under
Stevens
spell
I
had
already
devoured
the
audiobook
yet
found
that
I
still
had
plenty
of
room
for
dessert
Sports
porn
is
most
effective
when
it
s
audacious
People
aren
t
supposed
to
have
fun
in
such
dangerous
ways
yet
here
they
are
free-climbing
up
sheer
sandstone
Stevens
didn
t
reveal
much
about
himself
but
he
loved
being
the
center
of
attention
The
front
wheel
of
his
penny-farthing
was
50
inches
tall
and
Stevens
coasted
into
villages
where
bicycles
had
never
been
seen
In
his
telling
Stevens
constantly
explains
what
the
bicycle
is
and
he
entertains
crowds
by
demonstrating
its
use
More
than
once
strangers
offer
to
buy
the
bike
from
him
Stevens
craved
the
attention
and
readers
were
eager
to
pay
it
For
a
21st-century
reader
like
me
the
real
value
of
Around
the
World
on
a
Bicycle
is
accidental
It
freezes
time
Stevens
was
a
sportsman
and
tourist
he
saw
the
world
at
street
level
He
may
not
have
been
a
reliable
anthropologist
but
the
author
painstakingly
described
what
these
lands
looked
and
felt
like
to
an
ordinary
Western
visitor
Stevens
exhibits
a
mindfulness
that
modern
people
still
labor
to
attain
Given
enough
time
pornography
transforms
into
documentary
To
Stevens
writing
a
book
about
a
global
cycling
tour
was
a
business
op
with
a
built-in
publicity
stunt
Today
his
account
sheds
light
on
a
bygone
world
And
the
inspiration
remains
timeless
and
pure
unsullied
by
subtext
or
character
development
More
than
a
century
later
Stevens
still
urges
readers
onward
to
propel
ourselves
forward
to
see
how
far
we
can
go

These
are
dark
days
for
hope
From

ongoing
ever-mutating

pandemic
to

and
the
threat

to
an
impeccably
researched
3,600-page

to

the

Every

my

me
with

unending
stream
of
thoughtful
articulate
articles
explaining
exactly
why
I
should
be
even
more
worried
than
I
already
am
As

as
I
know
I
should
look

views
that
barrage
of
bad
news
as
the
cost
of
being
an
informed
participant
in
society
Hope
can
feel
like
a
guilty
pleasure
the
sugar
on
the
cereal
of
serious
thought
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
if
at
all
Starting
the
day
with
a
dose
of
doom
is
just
what
adults
do
Instead
of
hope
our
culture
keeps
delivering
new
ways
to
throw
its
hands
up
in
defeat
Prestige
TV
is
drowning
in
dystopias
showing
us
how
our
darkest
impulses
and
noblest
aspirations
will
all
turn
out
for
the
worst
Meanwhile
collective
dreams
of
saving
the
Earth
have
largely
made
way
for
individualist
fantasies
of
replacing
it
with
the
world
s
richest
men
putting
billions
into
immersive
simulations
and
interplanetary
escape
hatches
The
assumption
seems
to
be
that
this
world
s
already
a
lost
cause
so
we
might
as
well
replace
it
Lately
though
I
ve
been
trying
my
best
to
shake
that
mindset
If
we
re
going
to
face
up
to
the
seemingly
insurmountable
tasks
ahead
hope
isn
t
a
luxury
it
s
a
necessity
The
challenge
is
approaching
hope
in
a
way
that
feels
realistic
Easy
answers
can
be
as
dangerous
as
pure
defeatism
but
if
we
re
going
to
convince
ourselves
to
change
we
need
better
futures
to
aspire
to
not
just
worse
ones
to
avoid
I
ve
always
had
difficulty
imagining
a
better
world
In
high
school
tasked
with
a
group
project
to
design
the
political
economic
and
cultural
realities
of
a
future
paradise
our
four-person
team
split
into
two
irreconcilable
factions
with
my
partner
and
I
arguing
that
a
true
Utopia
was
simply
impossible
We
suggested
instead
a
Matrix-style
virtual
world
we
called
Inscience
from
the
Latin
for
lack
of
knowledge
where
everyone
would
at
least
have
the
illusion
of
happiness
It
was
a
cop-out
in
the
same
way
that
escaping
to
a
colony
on
Mars
is
a
cop-out
We
weren
t
engaging
with
the
actual
assignment
because
the
task
was
simply
too
big
Fortunately
there
are
others
who
are
more
up
to
the
job
than
our
teen
selves
were
Science
fiction
authors
who
challenge
themselves
to
move
beyond
cynicism
to
more
hopeful
and
genuinely
disruptive
futures
Ecologists
who
grapple
with
the
complexity
of
Earth
s
ecosystems
and
search
for
new
ways
to
embrace
that
complexity
rather
than
control
it
Writers
thinkers
and
activists
who
don
t
turn
away
from
the
peril
they
see
surrounding
us
but
who
also
refuse
to
let
that
be
all
they
see
The
late
Thích
Nhất
Hạnh
described
compassion
as
a
North
Star
writing
in
1987
s
Being
Peace
that
If
I
lose
my
direction
I
have
to
look
for
the
North
Star
and
I
go
to
the
north
That
does
not
mean
I
expect
to
arrive
at
the
North
Star
I
just
want
to
go
in
that
direction
Imagining
a
better
future
seems
to
work
the
same
way
It
isn
t
about
escaping
from
reality
it
s
about
finding
your
way
when
you
re
feeling
lost
The
inspiration
for
a
better
future
can
come
from
countless
sources
and
as
the
pieces
below
will
attest
whether
our
North
Star
is
fixed
in
a
firmament
of
scientific
fact
or
utopian
fiction
isn
t
what
s
important
After
all
following
it
doesn
t
give
us
license
to
ignore
the
terrain
we
re
walking
on
There
s
still
the
risk
that
we
ll
stumble
and
fall
but
at
least
we
can
point
ourselves
in
the
right
direction
One
of
the
grandest
gestures
toward
imagining
the
future
is
the
Clock
of
the
Long
Now
Originally
conceived
by
inventor
computer
scientist
and
Disney
Imagineering
fellow
Danny
Hillis
and
expected
to
cost
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
the
clock
is
designed
to
keep
time
for
10,000
years
Besides
being
a
tremendous
feat
of
engineering
it
s
also
a
tremendous
statement
of
faith
building
it
is
a
bet
that
there
will
be
humans
around
over
the
next
10
millennia
to
hear
its
bells
ring
Plenty
of
articles
have
talked
about
the
Clock
one
of
the
earliest
I
could
find
was
a
tangent
in
a
1997
New
Yorker
piece
on
the
futurist
visions
of
Imagineers
but
none
of
them
grappled
with
its
significance
quite
like
The
Future
Will
Have
to
Wait
As
much
as
it
describes
the
Clock
it
s
more
about
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
Long
Now
Foundation
to
encourage
humanity
to
think
on
longer
time
scales
and
the
powerful
emotions
that
can
emerge
just
from
imagining
our
survival
into
the
far
future
The
point
of
the
Clock
of
the
Long
Now
is
not
to
measure
out
the
passage
into
their
unknown
future
of
the
race
of
creatures
that
built
it
The
point
of
the
Clock
is
to
revive
and
restore
the
whole
idea
of
the
Future
to
get
us
thinking
about
the
Future
again
to
the
degree
if
not
in
quite
the
way
same
way
that
we
used
to
do
and
to
reintroduce
the
notion
that
we
don
t
just
bequeath
the
future—though
we
do
whether
we
think
about
it
or
not
We
also
in
the
very
broadest
sense
of
the
first
person
plural
pronoun
inherit
it
As
much
as
Chabon
s
thoughts
on
the
Clock
resonated
with
my
own
his
description
of
his
8-year-old
son
s
reaction
is
what
gives
the
piece
its
heart
It
s
a
reminder
that
the
stories
we
tell
genuinely
can
change
how
we
see
the
world
If
narratives
really
are
powerful
enough
to
shape
our
future
and
there
s
plenty
of
research
saying
that
they
are
then
we
should
probably
be
careful
about
the
stories
we
put
out
into
the
world
Not
that
there
isn
t
a
place
for
stories
about
our
darker
side
but
when
every
story
focuses
on
the
idea
that
we
re
one
disaster
away
from
the
collapse
of
civilization
it
doesn
t
give
much
to
aspire
to
Science
fiction
author
and
activist
Cory
Doctorow
describes
that
realization
in
this
2020
essay
written
as
part
of
Slate
s
Future
Tense
series
on
emerging
technology
public
policy
and
society
Reflecting
on
the
role
of
stories
in
shaping
our
mindset
he
brings
up
philosopher
Daniel
Dennett
s
idea
of
intuition
pumps
thought
experiments
designed
to
help
intuit
the
answers
to
complex
problems
Science
fiction
that
imagines
humanity
as
a
competitive
creature
hiding
beneath
a
veneer
of
cooperation
doesn
t
just
contradict
contemporary
research
into
humanity
s
origins
it
primes
our
pumps
with
exactly
the
wrong
intuitions
The
problem
is
it
s
wrong
It
makes
for
good
stories
but
those
stories
don
t
reflect
the
truth
of
the
world
as
I
see
it
Humanity
is
on
balance
good
We
have
done
remarkable
things
The
fact
that
we
remain
here
today
after
so
many
disasters
in
our
species
history
is
a
reminder
that
we
are
a
species
of
self-rescuing
princesses—characters
who
save
one
another
in
crisis
rather
than
turning
on
ourselves
Doctorow
goes
on
to
describe
how
that
insight
has
influenced
his
writing
and
it
s
fascinating
to
see
an
author
confront
the
cynicism
of
their
past
work
His
newer
stories
are
still
far
from
Utopian
but
by
putting
the
potential
for
change
at
their
heart
they
re
more
likely
to
inspire
progress
in
the
real
world
In
early
2022
Wired
released
a
collection
called
The
Future
of
Futures
that
could
easily
have
been
a
whole
reading
list
in
itself
Tempting
as
it
was
to
include
that
series
article
on
Tropical
Futurism
and
alternative
visions
of
tomorrow
it
was
edged
out
by
another
Wired
article
from
a
few
months
earlier
Jason
Kehe
s
profile
of
science
fiction
author
Becky
Chambers
To
describe
the
unique
mood
of
Chambers
brand
of
science
fiction
Kehe
keeps
returning
to
the
metaphor
of
a
pot
of
tea
Unlike
the
epic
space
operas
that
many
people
associate
with
sci-fi
her
stories
are
calming
complex
the
drink
of
choice
for
the
clear-headed
among
us
Her
writing
falls
into
a
genre
called
hopepunk
one
of
a
bouquet
of
alternatives
to
the
dourness
of
cyberpunk
that
have
begun
blooming
in
the
underground
sci-fi
landscape
For
Chambers
who
didn
t
ask
to
be
labeled
hopepunk
but
likes
the
term
very
much
the
simple
act
of
being
kind
in
her
writing
of
imagining
futures
in
which
decency
triumphs
and
people
are
allowed
to
cry
tears
of
joy
qualifies
as
more
than
sufficiently
rebellious
in
the
21st
century
You
re
looking
at
the
world
exactly
as
it
is
with
all
of
its
grimness
and
all
of
its
tragedy
and
you
say
No
I
believe
this
can
be
better
she
says
That
to
me
is
punk
as
hell
Although
Chambers
stories
aren
t
speculative
in
the
same
sense
as
writers
like
Doctorow
or
Kim
Stanley
Robinson
probably
the
most
prominent
name
in
contemporary
utopianism
that
doesn
t
detract
from
their
aspirational
power
Tea
leaves
may
not
be
the
most
scientifically
sound
way
to
look
at
the
future
but
that
doesn
t
stop
them
from
firing
some
imaginations
Coincidentally
taking
its
title
from
an
album
by
Long
Now
Foundation
co-founder
and
music
icon
Brian
Eno
Jessica
Camille
Aguirre
s
profile
of
amateur
scientist
Kai
Staats
lives
right
on
the
border
between
science
fiction
and
science
fact
Staats
goal
is
real
enough
the
self-contained
biome
he
s
designing
is
a
descendent
of
the
Biosphere
2
project
and
a
hopeful
predecessor
to
a
colony
on
Mars
but
whether
a
system
as
complex
and
chaotic
as
our
ecosystem
can
really
be
condensed
into
a
single
space
capsule
is
still
an
open
question
Like
Chabon
s
piece
on
the
Clock
of
the
Long
Now
though
Aguirre
isn
t
just
writing
about
a
single
project
It
s
about
the
challenges
of
space
exploration
but
it
s
also
about
what
the
desire
for
exploration
says
about
us
as
a
species
and
why
some
people
feel
such
a
visceral
compulsion
to
leave
the
planet
and
found
a
new
home
for
humanity
And
even
if
that
proves
impossible
it
s
also
about
how
the
project
s
complexity
helps
create
a
new
appreciation
for
Earth
and
just
how
miraculous
the
original
Biosphere
really
is
I
thought
about
a
conversation
I
had
months
before
with
Francesc
Godia
Casablancas
a
chemical
engineer
who
runs
the
ESA
s
pilot
plant
in
Barcelona
one
of
the
most
complex
biological
life-support
systems
ever
developed
He
told
me
that
no
matter
what
his
systems
would
always
lose
efficiency
over
time
the
simplified
biological
cycle
built
by
scientists
in
a
series
of
reactors
would
never
be
a
perfect
world
Living
on
a
planet
that
still
harbors
secrets
seemed
to
me
like
the
opposite
of
being
alone
There
is
a
strange
kind
of
companionship
in
the
tension
of
not
knowing
in
the
fact
that
the
systems
supporting
life
on
Earth
operate
beyond
our
control
Next
to
the
big
bold
future
of
interplanetary
travel
a
more
efficient
landfill
may
seem
like
an
excessively
modest
goal
But
pound
for
pound
the
ground-level
optimism
that
Andrea
McGuire
brings
to
her
profile
of
Newfoundland-based
startup
3F
Waste
Recovery
is
as
restorative
as
anything
you
ll
read
this
year
Connecting
the
company
s
circular
economics
equally
to
Canadian
East
Coast
salvage
culture
and
author
Neal
Stephenson
s
futuristic
technologies
she
subtly
makes
the
case
that
building
a
better
world
might
be
less
reliant
on
new
technologies
than
new
mindsets
Sci-fi
often
paints
the
future
as
an
increasingly
virtual
dystopia
But
a
book
like
[
Neal
Stephenson
s
]
The
Diamond
Age
pulses
with
inventive
possibilities
that
could
lead
to
more
grounded
ecologically
sound
possibilities
too
For
Wiper
the
sparsely
populated
Northern
Peninsula
is
the
best
place
to
nurture
his
utopic
sci-fi–inspired
ideals
Here
he
and
his
team
are
less
shackled
less
constrained
than
they
d
be
in
a
denser
more
centralized
region
he
says
There
s
plenty
of
space
for
experimenting—which
is
an
important
consideration
since
as
Lynch
tells
me
experimentation
is
absolutely
crucial
for
the
circular
economy
The
idea
of
fusing
future
thinking
and
traditional
knowledge
is
taken
even
further
in
Low-tech
Magazine
s
Obsolete
Technology
series
which
looks
to
seemingly
outdated
processes
like
using
urban
fish
ponds
for
sewage
processing
or
the
revolutionary
potential
of
the
hot
water
bottle
It
s
a
circular
spin
on
William
Gibson
s
oft-quoted
line
about
the
future
s
uneven
distribution
Sometimes
the
future
is
actually
in
the
past
It
s
nearly
impossible
to
talk
about
better
futures
without
bringing
up
Kim
Stanley
Robinson
Dubbed
the
gold-standard
of
realistic
and
highly
literary
science-fiction
writing
by
The
Atlantic
the
author
of
the
iconic
Mars
trilogy
has
used
his
novels
to
explore
topics
from
climate
change
and
environmentalism
to
post-capitalist
economics
with
a
hard-won
hopefulness
and
it
seems
fitting
to
give
him
the
last
word
Robinson
s
2018
essay
for
Commune
is
ostensibly
about
dystopian
writing
but
as
with
Doctorow
s
article
above
it
s
really
a
call
to
put
our
collective
imagination
to
better
use
We
have
the
raw
materials
for
a
better
future
a
planet
that
is
more
than
capable
of
sustaining
us
a
sun
that
provides
ample
energy
and
the
ability
to
think
creatively
about
how
to
build
a
sustainable
civilization
Worrying
can
only
take
us
so
far
especially
in
our
imagined
worlds
It
s
time
to
do
the
work
of
hope
Or
maybe
we
should
just
give
up
entirely
on
optimism
or
pessimism—we
have
to
do
this
work
no
matter
how
we
feel
about
it
So
by
force
of
will
or
the
sheer
default
of
emergency
we
make
ourselves
have
utopian
thoughts
and
ideas
This
is
the
necessary
next
step
following
the
dystopian
moment
without
which
dystopia
is
stuck
at
a
level
of
political
quietism
that
can
make
it
just
another
tool
of
control
and
of
things-as-they-are
The
situation
is
bad
yes
okay
enough
of
that
we
know
that
already
Dystopia
has
done
its
job
it
s
old
news
now
perhaps
it
s
self-indulgence
to
stay
stuck
in
that
place
any
more
Next

utopia

or
not

perhaps
especially

not

reach
the
mirror
My
tight
and
anxious
heart
The
night
I
couldn
t
stay
another
day
My
great
escape
My
father
has
summoned
me
After
a
lifetime
away
I
m
back
in
Edmonton
this
outpost
long
deserted
by
his
children
The
cold
industrial
city
was
not
for
us
Was
it
Edmonton
we
hated
or
the
nest
that
hatched
us
No
matter
We
blamed
our
migration
on
the
city
s
endless
winters
and
whisper-thin
summers
and
on
the
pull
of
Elsewhere
Only
one
brother
stayed
in
Alberta
choosing
a
city
beyond
my
mother
s
reach
My
father
has
never
connected
the
dots
on
our
staggered
exodus
He
tags
us
by
phone
taking
pride
in
his
artistic
sons
the
Painter
the
Guitarist
the
Cellist
Less
boast-worthy
is
the
Financial
Planner
though
he
s
kept
our
parents
solvent
through
a
long
retirement
As
for
me
his
only
daughter
he
s
never
said
much
about
my
years
as
a
missionary
To
him
I
ve
always
been
the
Writer
Now
I
m
finally
writing
but
I
don
t
tell
him
afraid
my
excavations
will
break
his
ancient
heart
We
don
t
know
how
he
s
done
it
57
years
in
that
house
but
my
mother
s
dementia
is
the
last
straw
on
the
bumpy
back
of
wedlock
and
he
wants
out
Not
divorce
but
a
fresh
start
where
he
can
tread
water
until
Alice
wife
great-grandmother
difficult
person
goes
into
full-time
care
He
wants
release
even
if
it
means
giving
up
the
house
How
much
longer
do
you
think
she
has
he
asks
He
wants
prophetic
certainty
But
how
should
we
know
Alzheimer
s
is
a
tricky
beast
encroaching
without
a
schedule
The
only
sure
thing
is
defeat
One
of
them
has
to
crash
and
my
money
s
on
him
a
nervous
fretful
mess
undone
by
my
mother
s
break
from
reality
He
s
always
clung
to
logic
like
a
nun
clutching
a
rosary
and
the
scattered
beads
in
my
mother
s
head
are
rolling
in
every
direction
but
straight
I
won
t
be
visiting
her
every
day
when
she
goes
in
he
says
She
won
t
even
know
if
I
come
or
what
day
it
is
What
s
the
point
As
always
my
father
s
reason
overrides
his
sensitivity
But
I
will
visit
sometimes
he
adds
not
wanting
to
appear
heartless
Of
course
I
ll
go
Maybe
once
a
week
that
should
be
fine
The
irony
is
that
Alzheimer
s
has
melted
my
mother
s
quills
she
s
less
prickly
than
she
s
ever
been
But
my
father
can
t
deal
with
this
new
softer
Alice
floating
in
her
noncombative
dream
state
She
s
unfamiliar
This
saddens
me
After
five
willful
children
and
one
emotional
affair
they
ve
been
through
the
wringer
together
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle
as
my
mother
would
say
But
now
he
won
t
get
the
pleasure
of
reminiscing
with
her
whitewashing
the
past
They
can
t
have
a
rational
conversation
anymore
She
can
t
keep
track
of
whose
house
she
s
in
let
alone
remember
what
happened
in
it
The
beads
are
everywhere
My
brother
Phil
the
Artist
suggests
a
quiet
green
retirement
park
five
minutes
from
his
Vancouver
Island
home
My
parents
can
sell
the
house
and
buy
a
prefab
unit
five
times
smaller
than
the
homestead
A
nursing
home
slumbers
nearby
where
my
mother
can
go
after
enough
residents
die
My
father
resisting
change
says
no
for
a
year
But
now
he
s
ready
Anticipating
Alice
s
resistance
he
gets
power
of
attorney
and
concocts
a
ruse
in
case
she
asks
about
the
realtors
traipsing
through
the
house
Most
of
the
time
she
doesn
t
even
notice
the
visitors
he
says
But
when
she
does
I
tell
her
these
people
are
thinking
of
buying
a
different
old
house
and
they
re
looking
at
ours
to
get
some
decorating
ideas
He
figures
this
ploy
will
flatter
my
mother
To
me
it
confirms
how
fully
delusional
both
have
become
The
house
never
a
paragon
of
style
in
its
heyday
and
now
wallowing
in
decrepitude
is
hardly
a
site
for
inspiration
unless
you
need
hellfire
motivation
to
purge
your
house
of
overflow
before
it
swallows
you
alive
Decision
made
my
father
leaps
at
the
first
buyer
less
eager
for
top
dollar
than
to
close
the
deal
and
skedaddle
The
house
sells
As
Is
the
only
way
it
could
be
sold
Trying
to
fancy
it
up
would
be
like
reassembling
a
butchered
hog
and
hoping
to
sell
it
back
to
the
farm
The
buyers
want
location
and
have
plans
to
gut
the
house
My
father
agrees
to
empty
the
house
and
skip
the
cleaning
I
sold
the
house
he
crows
in
April
We
have
till
July
3
to
empty
it
Phil
s
coming
in
June
and
we
re
going
to
finish
in
10
days
and
drive
back
with
him
He
said
you
d
help
You
can
sleep
in
Brian
s
room
while
you
re
here
I
really
appreciate
your
offer
No
one
has
actually
asked
me
to
help
My
father
simply
morphs
a
suggestion
into
a
plan
as
I
lie
sleeping
elsewhere
blissfully
unaware
that
the
hardest
job
of
my
life
has
finally
arrived
As
June
approaches
I
dither
daily
The
prospect
of
emptying
the
house
in
nine
days
overwhelms
me
This
job
warrants
months
if
not
years
time
to
sort
and
allocate
a
lifetime
of
objects
I
d
imagined
unearthing
the
house
after
my
parents
death
on
a
leisurely
timeline
I
d
imagined
my
brothers
pitching
in
light
banter
and
debate
as
we
sift
for
treasure
and
divide
the
loot
free
of
parental
oversight
While
I
dither
my
father
calls
frequently
to
bemoan
his
plight
and
thank
me
for
my
service
You
re
coming
in
June
right
He
never
waits
for
an
answer
I
really
appreciate
it
His
anxiety
zings
through
the
phone
and
I
know
any
hint
of
indecision
might
undo
him
Sure
I
say
First
week
of
June
It
s
on
my
calendar
But
the
prospect
makes
my
heart
race
and
not
in
a
good
way
My
father
insists
on
putting
Alice
on
the
phone
for
brief
chats
and
it
s
clear
things
have
changed
there
s
a
blank
where
my
voice
used
to
register
My
own
nuclear
family
has
also
been
expunged
a
relief
after
years
of
disapproval
Her
grudges
have
evaporated
She
no
longer
remembers
whom
she
hates
or
the
cases
she
s
built
against
them
An
unexpected
too-little-too-late
miracle
Even
with
the
new
Alice
I
pray
for
a
solid
excuse
to
bow
out
a
June
date
for
my
pending
knee
surgery
new
work
clients
a
possible
airline
strike
One
by
one
the
excuses
evaporate
I
book
my
flight
and
check
the
Edmonton
forecast
cloudy
stormy
and
unseasonably
cold
perfectly
suited
to
the
circumstances
No
matter
how
I
dither
I
am
manifestly
destined
to
go
On
June
1
I
fly
from
summery
Kelowna
and
land
in
the
city
of
my
birth
A
typical
spring
day
in
Edmonton
blustery
wet
and
gray
In
the
sweep
of
an
hour
I
ve
watched
the
gorgeous
Okanagan
hills
recede
glimpsed
the
Rockies
through
diaphanous
clouds
and
gazed
in
a
mixture
of
dismay
and
nostalgia
at
the
flat
almost
featureless
farmland
around
Edmonton
I
d
forgotten
the
starkness
of
the
prairies
when
the
sun
isn
t
brightening
things
up
The
soil
is
black
dotted
with
anorexic
barely
dressed
trees
And
the
city
spreading
like
spilled
ink
as
we
descend
neither
sparkles
nor
shines
I
imagined
the
trip
s
saving
grace
would
be
visiting
friends
after
years
away
But
the
nine-day
emptying
will
demand
every
minute
precluding
my
fantasies
Instead
I
ve
asked
two
friends
to
pick
me
up
delaying
my
parental
reunion
At
10:00
p.
m
we
drive
to
the
house
It
s
nearly
solstice
at
the
45th
parallel
light
enough
to
survey
the
neighborhood
Sturdy
trees
have
risen
from
saplings
planted
in
the
60s
when
the
community
was
a
muddy
field
under
construction
My
childhood
stomping
grounds
have
aged
into
an
elegant
old
lady
coiffed
and
respectable
In
every
yard
botanicals
have
been
clipped
into
tidy
conformity
Everywhere
but
here
My
parents
house
is
invisible
engulfed
by
overgrowth
An
enormous
birch
devours
the
lawn
now
a
pocket
of
wilderness
heaped
with
blackened
branches
The
hedge
has
tripled
in
height
and
four
enormous
pines
once
Arbor
Day
twiglets
sway
above
the
roofline
like
drunken
soldiers
This
descent
into
jungledom
was
inevitable
Alice
never
believed
in
pulling
weeds
or
removing
dead
branches
Nature
always
took
precedence
I
wear
no
overcoat
but
if
I
had
I
d
have
pulled
up
my
collar
and
slunk
up
the
buckling
driveway
like
Dick
Tracy
on
a
murder
investigation
I
d
expect
to
find
one
or
two
wraiths
in
the
house
hiding
from
the
21st
century

My
father
shuffling
by
cane
is
slow
so
Alice
gets
there
first
opening
the
door
with
a
friendly
but
questioning
smile
Who
is
this
stranger
at
her
door
I
m
shocked
by
her
white
unwashed
hair
flowing
past
her
bony
shoulders
She
s
never
worn
long
hair
and
it
softens
her
making
her
childlike
and
vulnerable
These
are
the
last
words
I
d
use
to
describe
my
mother
She
s
always
been
opinionated
ferocious
oppositional
But
now
she
grins
like
a
fairy-tale
gnome
wearing
a
nubby
pullover
and
floppy
green
sweatpants
I
m
anonymous
and
she
s
happy
in
her
new
generic
way
to
see
me
She
s
always
been
kinder
with
strangers
than
familiars
and
now
that
the
realtors
are
gone
the
doorbell
s
been
silent
I
m
welcome
My
father
never
says
hello
when
he
sees
me
even
if
it
s
been
months
or
years
apart
Instead
he
jumps
in
medias
res
launching
frantic
questions
or
updates
on
his
latest
obsessions
This
time
he
lobs
a
trifecta
of
worries
the
timing
of
my
brother
s
arrival
when
my
nephew
plans
to
pick
up
the
pool
table
and
whether
I
plan
to
spend
every
night
under
their
roof
We
ve
already
discussed
these
things
by
phone
multiple
times
He
s
reaching
new
heights
of
anxious
obsession
Hi
Dad
I
eventually
say
How
was
your
trip
He
never
gets
the
joke
Now
he
s
onto
the
next
worry
the
tail-wagging
canine
at
my
side
You
brought
someone
s
dog
with
you
No
Dad
it
s
my
dog
Casper
I
told
you
I
was
bringing
him
several
times
Your
mother
doesn
t
like
dogs
he
says
I
know
this
Alice
always
hated
dogs
and
this
will
be
the
first
time
a
dog
sleeps
under
her
roof
I
know
Dad
But
she
doesn
t
even
know
where
she
IS
anymore
She
can
t
remember
what
she
hates
She
doesn
t
even
know
ME
anymore
She
ll
be
fine
My
mother
is
instantly
smitten
A
dog
What
s
the
doggie
s
name
She
ll
repeat
these
words
endlessly
over
the
next
nine
days
surprised
each
time
she
sees
him
His
provenance
and
name
escape
her
Sometimes
intriguingly
she
calls
him
Alice
Does
she
know
where
her
pups
are
Does
she
remember
where
she
put
them
Bringing
him
is
genius
Casper
engages
her
inner
child
She
adores
him
more
than
she
ever
adored
me
Which
is
fine
I
just
wish
Old
Alice
could
see
what
New
Alice
is
up
to
She
d
be
absolutely
livid
She
s
talking
to
invisibles
imagining
strangers
and
children
in
the
house
The
children
are
younger
versions
of
my
brothers
currently
missing
she
ll
set
extra
places
at
the
table
and
wonder
when
they
ll
be
back
She
s
obsessed
yet
never
panicked
Her
mother
dead
for
25
years
also
lurks
nearby
This
spooks
my
father
The
missing
child
is
never
me
As
the
week
progresses
I
observe
her
monologues
recounting
her
life
story
or
rather
the
first
20
years
She
gets
hazy
once
she
hits
motherhood
unsure
what
came
next
Those
weren
t
the
happy
bits
But
her
early
life
is
crystal
clear
and
she
its
radiant
star
Her
Ukrainian-Canadian
childhood
is
now
the
Broadway
version
and
comes
with
a
rapt
audience
The
invisibles
never
interrupt
My
father
also
watches
wearing
his
new
shock-and-dismay
expression
Get
used
to
it
Dad
I
say
This
is
the
new
reality
At
least
we
don
t
have
to
listen
to
the
same
old
stories
She
s
found
new
friends
and
they
obviously
love
her
To
me
her
monologues
are
a
godsend
We
don
t
need
to
eavesdrop
her
stories
don
t
contain
us
Instead
we
can
tackle
our
epic
task
packing
up
her
later
darker
world
and
closing
its
doors
Apart
from
countless
phone
calls
my
father
has
done
nothing
to
prepare
for
the
emptying
Months
earlier
when
he
fretted
about
what
to
keep
I
d
suggested
a
simple
method
Go
to
the
dollar
store
and
buy
some
stickers
to
mark
things
Keep
Donate
To
be
Decided
Put
them
on
the
back
so
Mom
won
t
peel
them
off
If
nothing
else
I
thought
this
could
be
an
outlet
for
his
escalating
nervous
energy
He
hasn
t
marked
a
thing
Choosing
means
moving
forward
and
he
s
stuck
waiting
for
his
children
to
break
the
spell
He
hasn
t
tossed
a
single
paper
After
my
bathroom
inspection
I
ask
a
few
questions
The
dysfunctional
tub
is
as
lonely
as
it
looks
My
mother
won
t
bathe
anymore
More
alarming
is
my
father
s
blindness
to
the
house-wide
decay
The
toilet
in
particular
defies
polite
description
One
morning
he
asks
me
to
clean
it
for
the
new
owners
Um
Dad
I
don
t
think
there
s
much
point
Why
not
Can
t
you
scrub
out
the
stains
so
it
looks
better
Dad
those
stains
are
permanent
The
buyers
will
toss
the
toilet
and
gut
the
whole
house
That
s
why
it
s
selling
As
Is
Why
would
they
do
that
It
s
a
perfectly
good
toilet
His
eyesight
is
sharp
even
after
decades
of
anxious
spectating
Something
else
is
wrong
Maybe
57
years
of
staring
at
the
same
walls
renders
you
house-blind
though
he
s
taken
good
care
of
the
family
cabin
But
the
house
is
my
mother
s
domain
Dad
paid
the
bills
she
ruled
the
roost
His
mind
was
usually
elsewhere
And
now
that
she
s
mentally
flown
the
coop
he
s
lost
his
bearings
Alice
made
his
every
meal
and
drink
But
as
her
Alzheimer
s
progressed
her
kitchen
skills
disintegrated
She
forgot
how
to
turn
on
the
stove
and
put
plastics
in
the
oven
Her
inability
to
detect
moldy
food
verged
on
manslaughter
Faced
with
starvation
my
father
now
makes
coffee
eggs
toast
and
passable
suppers
of
fried
meat
with
corn-on-the-cob
Lunch
is
a
can
of
soup
divvied
between
them
He
s
also
mastered
oatmeal
which
my
mother
eats
daily
without
complaint
After
65
years
of
producing
three
meals
a
day
she
cast
off
her
duties
like
slipping
off
an
apron
displaying
zero
interest
in
the
kitchen
till
it
s
time
to
eat
Another
stunning
change
She
used
to
be
the
Kitchen
Nazi
now
she
s
like
royalty
visiting
royalty
waiting
to
be
served
On
the
second
morning
my
mother
shuffles
into
the
kitchen
Have
you
eaten
yet
I
ask
My
father
is
still
in
bed
Oh
no
I
don
t
cook
anymore
But
I
met
this
fella
who
likes
to
cook
for
me
He
always
makes
breakfast
She
sits
down
to
wait
for
her
fella
a
word
I
ve
never
heard
her
use
My
parents
have
always
shunned
lazy
speech
and
dutifully
pronounce
the
g
in
ing
words
My
father
predictably
goes
bananas
whenever
a
witness
on
the
news
says
I
seen
This
is
a
new
Alice
alright
she
isn
t
even
worried
her
fella
might
not
show
Alzheimer
s
has
given
her
a
refreshing
dollop
of
equanimity
Breakfast
whenever
is
fine
Oh
there
s
a
dog
she
says
catching
sight
of
Casper
What
s
the
doggie
s
name
I
sleep
in
the
Cellist
s
room
across
from
the
room
where
my
mother
sleeps
My
old
bedroom
was
reconfigured
into
a
small
library
within
months
of
my
running
away
as
my
parents
purged
every
trace
of
me
Nothing
from
my
girlhood
room
remains
except
the
hated
too-small
kitchen
curtains
my
mother
hung
when
I
was
5
They
re
mysteriously
intact
the
only
curtains
in
the
house
to
have
dodged
the
ravages
of
time
I
briefly
consider
taking
them
home
but
change
my
mind
They
won
t
fit
my
current
house
either
and
in
terms
of
nostalgia
they
ll
always
represent
my
mother
s
perversity
when
it
came
to
pleasing
me
In
every
other
room
the
curtains
she
d
chosen
at
least
covered
the
windows
and
none
of
my
brother
s
rooms
sported
kitchen
curtains
festooned
with
brassy
pots
and
pans
My
bedroom-turned-library
heaves
under
stacks
of
magazines
and
books
tomes
dating
back
to
the
1927
encyclopedias
I
used
for
school
reports
More
reference
books
have
accumulated
including
two
piles
of
concordances
from
my
grandfather
s
house
My
father
has
kept
them
despite
knowing
he
ll
never
use
them
given
his
aversion
to
Bible
study
and
his
father
s
strict
religion
Deep
issues
lay
bound
in
these
books
issues
he
ll
never
explore
He
s
also
kept
his
father
s
bookcases
now
covered
with
decades
of
office
paraphernalia
The
overpacked
motif
extends
to
every
room
crammed
with
duplicates
from
both
grandparents
homes
I
mutter
the
maxim
Keep
only
what
is
useful
or
beautiful
My
folks
obviously
missed
that
memo
embracing
the
opposite
Everything
might
be
useful
someday
They
re
Depression-era
hoarders
not
so
much
overshopping
as
using
things
past
the
point
of
death
then
stashing
them
Whatever
came
their
way
remained
except
their
children
At
the
foot
of
the
stairs
hangs
a
large
painting
that
confronts
every
trek
to
the
main
floor
After
57
years
of
daily
viewing
my
father
makes
a
passing
remark
prompted
by
the
task
of
winnowing
his
artwork
I
ve
never
liked
that
painting
he
says
Something
about
the
angle
on
that
mountain
isn
t
right
Can
you
see
it
It
s
always
bothered
me
that
angle
Then
why
on
earth
did
you
keep
it
I
ask
Why
didn
t
you
replace
it
with
a
picture
you
actually
enjoy
looking
at
every
day
My
father
looks
blank
It
s
always
been
there
In
contrast
to
my
former
bedroom
my
youngest
brother
s
room
is
a
shrine
brimming
with
books
sheet
music
and
dusty
childhood
keepsakes
his
bulletin
board
plastered
with
musical
accolades
This
one
the
Cellist
won
Alice
s
favor
We
siblings
call
him
the
Golden
Child
astonished
by
the
altered
mother
who
raised
him
Her
favoritism
always
seemed
unfair
But
it
wasn
t
his
fault
he
d
merely
run
with
his
talents
just
as
we
had
with
ours
The
difference
was
my
mother
s
affinity
for
classical
music
and
her
own
thwarted
dreams
He
took
center
stage
as
the
rest
of
us
fled
Now
he
s
studying
to
become
a
lawyer
to
my
mother
s
dismay
I
settle
into
his
narrow
twin
bed
trying
not
to
picture
the
stuff
in
every
room
squeezing
my
chest
like
a
stack
of
concordances
Tomorrow
I
decide
I
ll
start
in
the
basement
one
cobwebbed
corner
at
a
time
The
basement
A
rumpus
room
filled
with
a
pool
table
a
crokinole
board
three
card
tables
a
large
TV
an
ancient
radio
one
couch
five
armchairs
six
pairs
of
skis
a
hamper
stuffed
with
music
books
and
several
large
useless
pieces
of
wood
A
mantle
sagging
with
photos
art
projects
souvenirs
from
Canada
s
Centennial
1967
and
40
years
of
curling
trophies
Dust
to
match
Two
bookshelves
with
titles
from
every
decade
of
the
1900s
A
massive
closet
groaning
with
board
games
and
building
sets
from
the
last
mid-century
The
Toy
Closet
we
called
it
what
always
springs
to
mind
when
I
picture
my
childhood
home
Unearthing
that
room
will
be
interesting
Less
so
will
be
the
wine
cellar
jammed
with
hundreds
of
empty
wine
bottles
and
canned
food
from
the
60s
I
shake
a
blackened
can
of
peaches
and
its
contents
bounce
like
Silly
Putty
Above
more
deep
shelves
packed
with
hardware
and
camping
gear
including
the
massive
canvas
tent
we
pitched
and
dismantled
like
army
cadets
18
feet
long
nine
feet
high
and
almost
impossible
to
lift
It
s
rotted
beyond
repair
but
my
parents
have
kept
it
just
in
case
A
massive
freezer
packed
with
freezer-burned
casseroles
and
frost-bound
bread
Someone
s
willing
to
take
it
emptied
and
I
hack
at
years
of
ice
to
release
the
contents
traveling
decades
as
I
dig
At
bottom
waxy
fruit
cartons
dated
1972
peaches
and
pears
from
the
Okanagan
where
I
live
souvenirs
from
a
family
camping
trip
I
haul
countless
baskets
of
wasted
food
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
dumpster
we
ve
rented
one
that
seemed
ridiculously
large
when
it
arrived
filling
the
driveway
Soon
to
be
too
small
The
laundry
room
an
ancient
washing
machine
flanked
by
mountains
of
empty
containers
vats
of
desiccated
winemaking
supplies
and
piles
of
dirty
laundry
My
mother
is
unable
to
decipher
its
dials
anymore
and
my
father
is
too
overwhelmed
with
kitchen
duties
to
learn
another
skill
set
I
toss
a
load
into
the
washer
and
tackle
the
recycling
By
late
afternoon
I
ve
covered
the
back
garden
with
stacks
of
stuffed
bags
but
there
s
more
everywhere
I
look
Alice
was
obsessed
with
saving
containers
and
cookie
tins
some
empty
some
heavy
with
fossilized
Christmas
baking
One
splintering
laundry
basket
No
dryer
Alice
refused
She
believes
in
hanging
laundry
outside
Hordes
of
mosquitoes
attack
the
instant
I
step
outdoors
and
I
flee
in
search
of
repellent
Stored
among
fishing
supplies
in
the
basement
are
three
ancient
vials
of
repellent
and
I
wonder
if
20-year-old
ointment
still
works
It
does
Most
of
the
dried-up
clothespins
snap
in
half
as
I
hang
the
load
I
think
of
my
mother
slinging
laundry
in
Edmonton
winters
sometimes
at
30
below
What
misery
She
claimed
to
enjoy
herself
wrestling
with
bedsheets
as
magpies
cawed
in
her
backyard
jungle
Fair
enough
But
bird-filled
days
are
the
exception
not
the
rule
in
this
subarctic
city
and
I
m
struck
again
by
the
perversity
of
my
mother
s
choices
After
hanging
laundry
I
assess
the
Artist
s
basement
room
Phil
inherited
this
cubby
after
the
Cellist
s
birth
no
room
for
seven
on
the
second
floor
It
s
a
dank
claustrophobic
space
permanently
cold
with
narrow
windows
and
a
low
ceiling
No
provision
was
made
for
heating
and
Alice
turned
it
into
a
cold
cellar
after
Phil
left
Every
surface
is
stacked
with
her
infernal
containers
foil
pans
plastic
tubs
plastic
and
paper
bags
and
huge
jars
of
pickled
matter
that
defy
identification
Beneath
lie
remnants
of
my
brother
s
hole-and-corner
existence
upon
his
basement
banishment
but
it
takes
a
full
day
of
dragging
bags
into
the
garden
to
make
a
dint
When
Phil
arrives
a
day
later
I
show
him
the
astonishing
mounds
of
recycling
outside
and
then
his
room
the
outlines
of
furniture
still
covered
with
containers
and
grime
I
thought
you
d
like
to
finish
the
rest
Maybe
there
s
treasure
in
those
drawers
My
brother
looks
grim
I
doubt
it
This
room
wasn
t
a
happy
place
for
me
No
kidding
I
ask
for
details
a
conversation
we
ve
never
had
The
only
good
thing
about
this
room
was
sneaking
out
whenever
I
wanted
Mom
and
Dad
would
think
I
was
downstairs
working
on
my
art
but
I
couldn
t
stand
being
home
I
always
took
off
And
it
was
always
freezing
I
used
to
huddle
around
a
hairdryer
with
a
blanket
just
to
get
warm
I
d
hated
my
room
upstairs
with
its
lack
of
style
and
scary
view
of
the
refineries
unblocked
by
the
paltry
curtains
but
at
least
it
was
warm
Moored
in
my
own
despair
I
d
had
no
idea
of
Phil
s
unhappiness
Recent
talks
with
my
brothers
are
revealing
a
common
truth
We
d
all
been
lonely
in
this
house
unbeknownst
to
each
other
We
could
ve
helped
each
other
out
I
said
if
only
we
d
known
But
we
were
too
miserable
to
see
it
in
each
other
My
brother
picks
up
a
heavy
jar
of
purplish
pickles
and
sighs
What
could
we
have
done
even
if
we
had
The
only
solution
was
escape
I
envied
you
being
brave
enough
to
do
it
I
wished
I
could
ve
done
the
same
This
is
a
late-stage
revelation
I
never
imagined
being
envied
assuming
my
brothers
resented
the
angry
hole
I
d
left
behind
the
years
my
mother
ranted
at
my
getaway
I
knew
they
d
never
heard
the
end
of
it
Casper
my
17-year-old
mutt
follows
me
everywhere
Now
he
shadows
me
up
and
down
two
flights
of
stairs
as
I
empty
the
house
maybe
60
climbs
a
day
I
m
not
counting
but
the
work
is
constant
the
steps
steep
his
legs
short
and
a
huge
fatty
lump
on
his
chest
rubs
each
step
on
every
ascent
Several
times
a
day
I
accidentally
whack
him
with
bags
I
can
barely
lift
On
we
trudge
morning
till
night
for
seven
successive
days
Between
climbs
he
collapses
into
naps
or
circles
round
my
mother
enjoying
her
childlike
attention
I
m
not
exempt
from
stair
fatigue
even
though
I
ve
been
hiking
mountains
and
my
lungs
and
legs
are
strong
On
the
fifth
night
I
count
13
bruises
on
my
calves
and
thighs
and
wonder
if
my
legs
will
work
when
the
sun
returns
My
arms
dragging
bundles
boxes
and
furniture
are
also
bruised
and
weary
as
salmon
leaping
the
last
ladder
to
their
mountain
home
My
back
is
riddled
with
pain
My
head
is
aflame
On
the
second
evening
I
m
hit
with
a
virus
or
allergy
felling
me
with
pounding
congestion
weeping
eyes
and
a
death-rattle
cough
But
there
s
no
time
for
ailing
Like
an
injured
pirate
plundering
a
sinking
ship
I
press
on
There
s
a
deadline
to
this
work
fast
approaching
A
year
ago
this
would
ve
been
impossible
Alice
would
ve
blocked
every
bag
leaving
the
house
questioned
our
motives
railed
at
conspiracy
She
would
ve
chased
us
away
Now
she
holds
the
door
and
watches
the
dumpster
fill
oblivious
to
the
mountain
of
thrift-store
donations
piling
in
her
living
room
and
the
marathon
runs
to
the
recycling
depot
She
never
ventures
to
the
basement
to
see
what
we
re
doing
or
questions
my
rapid
dissembling
of
her
congested
kitchen
cupboards
More
ancient
plastics
40-year-old
spices
Aluminum
cups
from
1955
That
s
because
she
no
longer
knows
this
is
home
Instead
she
watches
me
her
nameless
hostess
as
I
pack
and
purge
never
asking
why
This
house
she
says
reminds
her
of
her
house
in
Edmonton
especially
the
clothesline
and
the
kitchen
window
But
it
s
not
her
house
and
not
her
laundry
whipping
in
the
wind
She
wants
to
go
home
but
first
she
needs
to
find
her
purse
Have
I
seen
it
anywhere
Her
latest
obsession
revolves
around
missing
objects
usually
a
purse
suitcase
or
piece
of
clothing
Thankfully
though
her
searches
last
days
her
anxiety
over
lost
items
is
low
I
unearth
at
least
30
purses
in
closets
and
drawers
most
with
Kleenex
and
singers
mints
tucked
inside
none
with
cash
My
father
handled
the
money
I
show
her
several
Is
this
your
missing
purse
No
she
tells
me
none
are
hers
but
she
hopes
their
owners
find
them
soon
Meanwhile
she
ll
keep
looking
I
pack
all
but
one
for
donation
and
set
the
remaining
bag
in
her
room
which
she
repeatedly
brings
back
insisting
it
s
not
hers
Days
later
she
claims
it
Now
if
she
could
just
find
her
suitcase
she
d
be
ready
to
pack
Eight
duffle
bags
and
suitcases
cover
the
spare
double
bed
in
her
room
surrounded
by
stacks
of
her
clothing
she
doesn
t
recognize
It
s
her
attempt
at
packing
says
my
father
She
wants
to
pack
and
go
home
but
the
surplus
overwhelms
her
I
slip
into
her
room
when
she
s
downstairs
and
incrementally
scale
down
the
piles
setting
usable
garments
and
bags
aside
in
case
she
asks
for
them
She
doesn
t
When
the
pile
is
small
and
manageable
she
calms
down
Someone
finally
cleaned
my
room
she
says
It
s
much
better
now
I
found
my
suitcase
But
minutes
later
she
starts
again
Have
you
seen
my
shoes
she
asks
I
bring
out
her
most
recent
shoes
at
least
10
pairs
dust-balled
in
the
front
hall
closet
None
are
hers
Simplicity
will
be
a
blessing
530
square
feet
sounds
perfect
The
less
we
send
on
their
way
the
better
Howard
the
Financial
Planner
devotes
hours
to
guiding
my
father
through
the
monetary
morass
of
buying
selling
and
moving
He
also
drives
up
three
times
during
our
feverish
purging
spree
to
lend
muscle
and
encouragement
If
anyone
s
been
underappreciated
in
our
family
it
s
Howard
but
instead
of
stewing
he
s
grown
a
heart
of
gold
After
running
heaps
of
recycling
to
the
depot
and
doing
a
lion
s
share
of
heavy
lifting
he
drives
home
and
spends
seven
hours
sorting
and
shredding
my
father
s
old
documents
As
the
only
in-province
sibling
he
s
been
quietly
serving
our
parents
for
years
without
complaint
I
make
a
point
of
commending
him
each
time
I
see
him
He
s
our
unsung
hero
With
unfortunate
timing
he
s
also
in
the
midst
of
buying
and
selling
his
own
homes
right
now
and
he
s
managing
all
this
plus
his
full-time
business
and
cracking
jokes
the
whole
time
As
Phil
and
I
work
Brother
Two
the
Guitarist
floats
between
us
Three
months
ago
he
died
of
cancer
the
first
in
our
family
to
go
and
he
keeps
turning
up
as
we
tunnel
through
our
childhood
Doug
escaped
the
house
the
minute
he
graduated
and
moved
west
three
decades
later
he
and
I
ended
up
living
10
minutes
apart
He
ought
to
be
here
sorting
through
board
games
and
building
sets
revisiting
the
Toy
Closet
and
claiming
his
lost
marbles
We
find
the
bag
soft
suede
with
a
leather
drawstring
labeled
by
his
8-year-old
hand
still
guarding
his
favorite
cat
s
eyes
aggies
and
steelies
I
see
him
catch
the
bag
and
run
outside
to
play
Doug
was
always
outdoors
We
find
his
trucks
and
microscopes
too
Doug
always
knew
how
to
get
the
best
gifts
Phil
sighs
It
s
true
as
a
child
he
had
an
uncanny
ability
to
get
what
he
wanted
But
life
s
a
stinker
and
cancer
eventually
canceled
his
magic
touch
Other
ghosts
emerge
Working
in
the
basement
on
Day
Three
Phil
runs
upstairs
with
a
small
framed
photo
that
s
fallen
from
a
stack
of
papers
It
s
me
and
Jack
the
fiancé
who
died
when
I
was
22
snapped
when
we
were
falling
in
love
It
s
the
only
photo
I
have
the
rest
have
gone
missing
over
time
Two
days
later
I
m
emptying
an
upstairs
closet
and
another
lost
treasure
falls
out
Jack
s
banjo
For
years
I
ve
chided
myself
for
losing
it
and
here
it
is
safe
and
snug
in
the
black
case
I
remember
a
beginner
s
manual
helpfully
tucked
inside
Happier
memories
hatch
from
these
objects
and
my
heart
soars
with
gratitude
Finding
these
objects
is
worth
the
trip
The
third
ghost
is
feline
Bravely
tackling
the
dusty
rusty
grimy
and
mosquito-infested
garage
my
brother
discovers
a
decrepit
yet
instantly
recognizable
bowl
Mousy
s
cat
dish
Mousy
was
born
in
1957
She
died
in
1973
Her
dish
has
sat
in
the
garage
untouched
for
almost
half
a
century
Before
turning
it
over
Phil
remembers
the
bowl
s
inscription
Bunny
s
Playtime
It
s
a
Peter
Rabbit
dish
circa
1930
probably
my
father
s
infant
dish
After
50
years
of
rest
it
s
getting
a
new
lease
I
dump
some
leftovers
inside
and
give
it
to
Casper
The
days
blur
I
move
from
floor
to
floor
stuffing
bags
for
the
landfill
and
donation
I
discover
the
extent
of
my
mother
s
hoarding
from
closets
of
clothes
dating
back
to
the
50s
every
shirt
washed
ironed
and
buttoned
from
neck
to
bottom
to
dozens
of
almost-identical
shoes
still
in
boxes
to
drawers
of
unopened
charity-appeal
letters
to
boxes
from
every
gift
her
children
have
sent
over
40
years
The
strangest
of
Alice
s
compulsions
are
scores
of
sweaters
she
s
folded
into
individual
shopping
bags
then
sealed
tight
with
wire
twisters
each
twisted
tightly
to
the
end
Once
packed
the
sweaters
are
stashed
into
drawers
and
high
shelves
invisible
inaccessible
and
forgotten
The
cardigans
and
pullovers
share
similar
styles
and
colors
and
perhaps
some
got
limited
exposure
before
joining
their
sisters
in
the
catacombs
I
used
to
wonder
what
Alice
did
in
her
lonely
house
after
we
scattered
Now
I
know
She
ironed
buttoned
folded
twist-tied
and
stashed
her
life
away
She
baked
and
froze
she
pickled
and
canned
and
stacked
She
sent
my
father
out
to
buy
more
of
the
same
groceries
she
d
already
squirreled
into
dark
corners
She
perpetually
prepared
for
the
next
trip
to
the
cabin
season
after
season
forgetting
the
prep
she
d
done
the
year
before
She
buried
most
of
her
grandchildren
s
photos
in
deep
drawers
She
never
donated
On
the
seventh
day
I
collapse
managing
only
a
few
hours
work
before
crashing
My
body
says
NO
my
second
wind
fails
to
rise
I
hobble
to
the
Cellist
s
room
and
fall
asleep
When
I
awake
everyone
s
eaten
supper
and
I
share
the
leftovers
with
Casper
before
crawling
back
to
bed
At
3:00
a.
m.
I
wake
to
a
howling
wind
slamming
branches
against
windows
and
keening
like
a
banshee
The
wind
never
sounds
like
this
where
I
live
Behind
the
howling
trains
mourn
in
the
distance
the
night
music
of
my
childhood
There
s
a
weird
energy
in
the
room
as
if
layers
we
ve
lifted
from
the
house
have
released
captive
spirits
The
strange
elation
that
s
powered
me
through
the
week
the
simple
joy
of
getting
things
done
deflates
into
a
nameless
dread
I
pull
the
blankets
tight
and
try
to
distract
myself
by
mentally
reciting
scripture
It
doesn
t
work
An
hour
later
I
m
jolted
by
a
loud
low-pitched
siren
unlike
any
I
ve
known
It
sounds
close
—right
outside
my
window
and
fiercely
insistent
and
my
first
thought
is
the
trumpet
of
God
but
for
its
constant
pitch
The
trumpet
of
God
will
blow
louder
and
louder
of
course
like
the
blast
at
Mount
Sinai
before
God
spoke
No
this
must
be
a
human
warning
signal
and
my
next
thought
is
Run
Seconds
later
I
stumble
downstairs
to
meet
Phil
who
in
similar
panic
has
grabbed
his
travel
bag
and
fled
the
basement
The
siren
sounds
like
it
s
inside
our
heads
We
dash
into
the
street
early-lit
in
the
solstice
sun
and
eerily
still
No
one
s
around
We
run
past
parked
cars
and
silent
windows
wondering
what
we
re
fleeing
Now
it
feels
like
we
re
unscripted
actors
in
a
bad-but-disturbing
rapture
movie
Baffled
we
run
back
to
the
house
and
turn
on
the
radio
surely
there
ll
be
news
My
brother
flicks
the
tuner
to
AM
and
flits
through
the
stations
but
the
motor-mouthed
hosts
rant
on
without
reference
to
a
new
more
urgent
emergency
I
run
upstairs
grab
my
laptop
and
Google
Edmonton
siren
emergency
alert
There
s
a
website
headed
with
a
red-lettered
caption
NO
ACTIVE
EMERGENCY
SIGNALS
We
discard
the
notion
of
an
alien
invasion
and
settle
on
the
most
likely
explanation
Something
s
happened
at
the
refineries
But
who
s
being
warned
Why
isn
t
anyone
moving
Should
we
jump
in
our
cars
and
escape
Where
The
unnerving
calm
in
the
neighborhood
convinces
us
to
stay
My
parents
haven
t
roused
either
so
maybe
they
re
all
used
to
this
whatever
this
is
A
full
hour
later
the
siren
stops
My
father
gets
up
at
the
usual
time
and
shuffles
downstairs
to
assume
his
Breakfast
Fella
duties
I
ask
him
about
the
siren
Did
you
hear
it
this
morning
What
on
earth
was
that
He
d
slept
through
all
but
a
minute
of
it
It
s
something
at
the
refineries
he
said
Something
must
ve
blown
But
so
loud
Lasting
an
hour
at
full
blast
It
s
usually
just
a
minute
or
two
I
ve
never
heard
it
go
that
long
And
the
whole
neighborhood
just
sleeps
right
through
it
I
m
amazed
at
our
human
capacity
to
adapt
to
the
unbearable
Almost
anything
can
seem
normal
if
it
s
inflicted
on
us
long
enough
Pondering
this
I
m
glad
I
didn
t
stick
around
that
I
ran
away
early
before
despair
stopped
feeling
dangerous
and
started
feeling
normal
Emptying
the
master
bedroom
takes
two
days
Besides
the
bags
of
cocooned
sweaters
and
fully
buttoned
shirts
there
are
at
least
18
overstuffed
drawers
two
groaning
desks
and
three
large
cedar
chests
all
jammed
with
papers
letters
wrapping
paper
bows
socks
underwear
winter
gear
or
costume
jewelry
I
ask
my
father
to
pull
out
the
clothes
he
wants
to
keep
but
he
passes
the
decision-making
back
to
me
There
s
a
huge
pool
to
choose
from
I
select
an
assortment
of
garments
spanning
decades
some
of
the
older
stuff
is
back
in
style
or
could
be
given
a
few
more
years
Besides
at
86
you
can
darn
well
wear
what
you
please
A
hand-stitched
silk
shirt
wrapped
in
a
dry-cleaning
bag
catches
my
eye
Judging
from
the
label
it
s
been
lolling
in
the
closet
since
the
60s
I
have
no
memory
of
my
father
wearing
it
and
it
s
classier
than
his
school-principal
wardrobe
Plus
it
s
in
immaculate
shape
I
put
it
on
the
Keep
pile
A
few
days
later
when
we
drive
down
to
see
my
brother
s
new
house
my
father
wears
it
along
with
a
pair
of
cords
from
the
80s
He
looks
pretty
spiff
My
mother
wears
the
same
clothes
for
weeks
on
end
the
same
baggy
green
sweatpants
and
high-necked
pullover
she
was
wearing
the
night
I
arrived
Not
surprisingly
she
smells
and
looks
like
a
homeless
person
But
every
attempt
to
wash
them
is
met
with
refusal
They
don
t
need
washing
she
tells
me
I
just
put
them
on
a
few
days
ago
Three
old-fashioned
nightgowns
hang
in
her
now-emptied
closet
and
each
night
she
chooses
the
same
grubby
one
If
we
had
a
dryer
I
could
wash
the
lot
overnight
and
have
them
ready
by
morning
but
the
cold
wet
weather
isn
t
cooperating
with
the
clothesline
I
weigh
my
options
decide
whether
it
s
more
important
to
have
her
somewhat
clean
or
somewhat
happy
Despite
her
global
confusion
she
s
fiercely
attached
to
her
three-piece
wardrobe
I
go
with
somewhat
happy
for
the
first
week
but
change
my
mind
after
she
wets
herself
and
still
maintains
her
pants
are
fresh
Into
the
wash
they
go
and
I
lay
a
fresh
set
of
garments
on
her
bed
for
morning
baggy
elasticized
pants
in
the
same
shade
of
green
and
a
fleecy
button-up
shirt
Purple
She
shuffles
down
for
breakfast
looking
fresher
despite
her
unwashed
hair
Someone
left
this
lovely
shirt
in
my
room
she
says
I
hope
they
don
t
mind
if
I
borrow
it
Have
you
seen
my
green
pullover
anywhere
It
s
hanging
outside
in
plain
view
from
the
kitchen
window
but
I
know
she
won
t
recognize
it
I
m
sure
it
ll
turn
up
I
say
Someone
must
ve
moved
it
My
mother
wanders
into
her
former
bedroom
while
I
m
stuffing
bags
and
planning
my
father
s
future
fashion
statements
Standing
by
the
bed
she
moves
things
around
undoing
my
piles
and
generally
getting
in
the
way
Do
you
want
to
go
downstairs
and
listen
to
some
music
I
ask
Listening
to
classical
music
the
music
of
her
life
is
the
one
thing
that
centers
her
She
doesn
t
She
wants
to
stay
here
and
look
for
her
missing
clothes
and
suitcases
I
guide
her
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
and
position
her
in
front
of
a
dust-covered
desk
now
stripped
of
clutter
You
could
wipe
off
this
desk
for
me
I
say
handing
her
a
damp
rag
It
really
needs
cleaning
Desk
she
says
looking
straight
at
it
I
need
to
look
for
my
suitcase
I
put
my
hand
over
hers
and
move
the
rag
over
the
desk
Like
this
See
how
dusty
it
is
She
dabs
at
a
corner
for
a
few
seconds
before
losing
interest
and
wandering
back
to
my
side
of
the
bed
where
she
starts
jumbling
through
my
piles
again
Mom
I
say
the
desk
Can
you
please
finish
cleaning
it
Desk
she
says
looking
blank
I
walk
her
back
to
the
corner
and
pick
up
the
rag
again
She
dabs
a
bit
more
before
shuffling
back
to
me
She
s
like
a
3-year-old
I
think
except
most
3-year-olds
could
finish
this
simple
task
I
give
up
trying
Let
s
go
downstairs
and
look
for
your
shoes
I
suggest
I
think
I
know
where
someone
might
have
moved
them
This
interests
her
I
ll
show
her
the
same
shoes
for
the
fifth
time
and
put
on
some
music
Maybe
she
ll
finally
recognize
her
10-year-old
shoes
Maybe
she
won
t
Either
way
I
ll
wait
till
she
s
lost
in
Handel
s
Water
Music
before
sneaking
back
upstairs
to
tackle
the
rest
in
peace
My
brother
keeps
pace
working
as
long
and
as
hard
as
I
while
suffering
with
his
own
handicap
He
s
had
a
migraine
the
whole
week
and
most
of
the
time
he
wears
a
thick
homemade
headpiece
fashioned
from
old
fabric
and
whatever
he
stuffed
inside
to
make
it
five
inches
thick
and
able
to
trap
cold
The
day
he
got
here
I
found
his
contraption
in
the
freezer
and
threw
it
in
the
trash
it
looked
like
something
the
cat
dragged
in
and
I
assumed
it
was
a
useless
mystery
item
from
my
parents
past
Luckily
he
spotted
it
before
the
trash
landed
in
the
dumpster
He
and
I
are
the
hardest
working
people
I
know
We
ve
tackled
the
impossible
together
This
delight
in
our
tenacity
buttressed
with
visible
mountains
of
staggering
achievement
carries
us
through
the
week
We
re
inspired
by
each
other
bonded
in
our
history
and
our
rediscovery
of
it
My
father
watching
us
fill
the
massive
dumpster
with
junk
and
the
living
room
with
a
lifetime
of
donations
makes
the
same
comment
over
and
over
You
re
being
very
ruthless
he
says
I
AM
ruthless
I
answer
I
HAVE
to
be
ruthless
If
I
weren
t
ruthless
we
couldn
t
get
this
baby
done
My
middle
name
is
Ruth
Each
time
we
have
this
exchange
I
m
reminded
of
a
silly
verse
my
father
used
to
recite
when
I
was
small
Ruth
and
Johnny
side
by
side
Went
out
for
a
motor
ride
They
hit
a
bump
Ruth
hit
a
tree
And
Johnny
rode
on
–
ruthlessly
I
love
being
ruthless
with
my
parents
stuff
It
compensates
for
all
the
years
they
weren
t
ruthless
materially
speaking
in
contrast
to
my
thrift-store
mentality
So
much
stuff
could
ve
been
reused
if
they
d
given
it
away
before
it
disintegrated
So
much
could
ve
been
shared
instead
of
hoarded
We
re
keeping
so
little
a
tiny
sliver
of
the
whole
rotting
pie
A
few
boxes
of
sentimental
items
photo
albums
and
certificates
will
travel
with
them
to
the
island
Maybe
dislodged
from
their
Edmonton
cave
and
viewed
in
fresh
light
they
ll
warrant
a
closer
look
Maybe
if
my
father
chooses
to
look
they
ll
speak
a
fresh
truth
But
he
ll
probably
be
too
busy
fretting
Miraculously
impossibly
we
meet
our
deadline
Three
men
from
a
thrift
store
spend
several
hours
filling
their
truck
with
the
furniture
lamps
rugs
hardware
and
mountains
of
boxed
and
bagged
items
we
ve
piled
in
the
living
room
For
the
first
time
in
57
years
the
front
room
sits
empty
its
battered
carpet
and
shredded
curtains
fully
exposed
except
for
a
handful
of
old
chairs
and
a
saggy
couch
the
thrift
store
refused
Even
with
adroit
stacking
my
brother
is
a
whiz
at
spatial
calculations
the
dumpster
is
loaded
beyond
capacity
when
the
pickup
takes
place
the
drivers
will
insist
on
bringing
a
second
dumpster
to
handle
the
overflow
*
We
ve
also
maxed-out
the
jumbo-sized
bins
at
several
recycling
depots
Hooked
to
my
father
s
SUV
a
compact
U-Haul
trailer
packed
with
all
the
earthly
goods
my
parents
are
taking
sits
ready
for
tomorrow
s
departure
day
My
duties
are
over
Phil
s
are
just
beginning
He
ll
caravan
with
them
over
the
Rockies
and
across
British
Columbia
1,160
kilometers
before
catching
the
ferry
to
his
island
town
Once
there
our
parents
will
stay
in
his
busy
house
for
a
month
in
his
master
bedroom
until
their
own
place
is
ready
Why
the
rush
you
may
wonder
Why
do
it
all
in
nine
days
No
one
tells
me
Perhaps
it
had
to
be
like
this
like
pulling
a
clotted
bandage
off
a
crusty
wound
Halfway
to
the
island
my
father
will
drive
his
truck
off
the
road
disconnecting
the
trailer
and
scattering
the
carefully
packed
contents
across
an
open
field
Several
things
will
break
The
trip
will
take
many
extra
days
including
a
return
trip
for
my
brother
to
pick
up
his
abandoned
vehicle
After
the
thrift-store
pickup
there
s
one
last
event
in
the
house
a
meeting
with
someone
from
the
Alberta
Alzheimer
s
Society
She
arrives
at
2
p.
m.
a
packet
of
general
information
in
hand
My
father
insists
we
all
attend
the
meeting
so
we
re
all
on
the
same
page
There
s
not
much
to
discuss
since
my
mother
will
no
longer
have
access
to
Alberta
services
and
our
liaison
lady
doesn
t
know
much
about
programs
in
British
Columbia
except
to
suggest
they
re
probably
much
the
same
Maddeningly
the
two
provinces
operate
like
former
East
and
West
Germany
when
it
comes
to
interprovincial
transitions
My
mother
joins
us
in
the
living
room
and
the
Alzheimer
s
lady
opens
the
meeting
by
looking
us
each
in
the
eye
to
make
sure
we
understand
the
rules
We
re
going
to
be
speaking
very
generically
here
today
she
says
shooting
a
swift
glance
at
Alice
I
trust
you
understand
why
And
so
it
begins
a
meeting
about
the
progression
and
outcomes
of
Alzheimer
s
without
saying
the
banned
words
Dementia
Alzheimer
s
Full-time
care
Assisted
living
It
s
like
a
crazy
game
of
Taboo
and
I
m
not
sure
why
we
re
playing
since
my
mother
s
clearly
not
on
the
same
page
or
even
on
the
same
planet
We
could
be
talking
about
murdering
her
and
dispersing
her
cut-up
remains
across
Canada
and
she
wouldn
t
bat
an
eye
Alice
how
do
you
feel
about
moving
to
Chemainus
my
father
asks
midway
through
the
generic
discussion
He
s
been
asking
the
same
question
all
week
and
getting
a
different
unrelated
answer
every
time
Well
I
was
never
happy
about
selling
the
house…
she
begins
and
we
all
turn
to
look
at
her
For
a
moment
it
seems
like
she
s
back
on
board
Maybe
she
s
been
messing
with
us
all
this
time
But
I
ve
always
been
a
singer
and
when
Dodie
came
to
the
cabin
I
knew
it
might
be
the
last
time
I
d
see
her…
And
she
s
off
spinning
fragments
of
her
life
and
memories
of
her
long-deceased
sister
into
a
tapestry
of
incoherence
Her
rambling
should
be
a
major
tip
off
to
our
facilitator
it
doesn
t
matter
what
words
we
use
but
she
s
heavily
indoctrinated
and
persists
in
word-avoidance
till
the
meeting
ends
My
father
wants
just
one
thing
from
her
How
much
longer
do
you
think
she
has
he
asks
for
the
umpteenth
time
and
the
four
of
us
practically
sing
out
the
disappointing
answer
Nobody
really
knows
You
ll
just
have
to
play
it
by
ear
I
m
forfeiting
my
return
ticket
to
drive
back
in
my
father
s
17-year-old
station
wagon
he
s
gifting
it
to
replace
my
daughter
s
old
beater
Driving
means
room
in
the
back
for
keepsakes
I
couldn
t
bring
on
the
plane
I
ve
reclaimed
my
childhood
desk
the
one
my
mother
hasn
t
finished
cleaning
and
nabbed
a
cedar
chest
and
an
early
painting
by
Phil
as
well
as
two
photo
albums
and
Jack
s
banjo
Phil
helps
me
pack
leaving
room
for
Casper
and
the
cat
dish
We
re
ready
for
takeoff
but
my
father
wants
me
to
stay
till
morning
so
we
can
all
leave
together
even
though
I
ll
be
taking
a
different
highway
home
My
oldest
best
friend
comes
for
a
final
visit
She
hasn
t
seen
Phil
since
the
early
80s
when
they
used
to
go
dancing
on
Friday
nights
She
hasn
t
seen
Howard
since
he
was
10
the
year
she
and
I
ran
away
together
She
s
avoided
seeing
my
mother
for
most
of
those
years
even
though
her
family
continued
to
live
in
the
house
across
the
lane
My
mother
never
liked
Laura
But
today
it
s
different
Today
Alice
greets
her
with
the
fuzzy
warmth
she
now
lavishes
on
everyone
She
hugs
her
After
the
initial
shock
of
seeing
a
childhood
friend
after
nearly
half
a
century
my
brothers
and
Laura
reconnect
I
make
a
pot
of
peppermint
tea
and
my
father
joins
us
round
the
makeshift
kitchen
table
for
a
spontaneous
reunion
Laura
last
stood
in
our
kitchen
48
years
ago
where
she
d
never
be
invited
to
sit
unless
it
was
my
birthday
and
now
she
s
drinking
tea
with
Alice
laughing
with
her
former
nemesis
and
looking
perfectly
at
home
She
s
always
felt
like
my
sister
today
she
almost
is
A
halo
seems
to
hang
above
the
room
Outside
the
wind
is
gathering
force
it
s
tornado
season
The
temperature
is
plunging
Sharp
rain
falls
from
a
purplish
darkening
sky
whipping
against
the
house
The
clock
says
6:00
p.
m.
almost
time
for
supper
if
anyone
cares
to
cobble
together
one
last
meal
The
fridge
is
almost
bare
but
in
this
family
we
re
good
at
making
something
out
of
fragments
I
stand
with
one
hand
on
the
fridge
beholding
the
moment
I
could
cook
but
I
m
not
staying
I
want
to
leave
with
this
scene
intact
For
one
sweet
moment
a
thrum
of
harmony
fills
the
emptied
house
I
say
my
goodbyes
slide
behind
the
wheel
and
let
the
wind
blow
me
home
It
s
the
perfect
time
to
leave

It
s
a
question
for
getting
dressed
getting
ready
getting
prepared
What
s
the
vibe
We
mean
lots
of
things
by
this
question
like
what
do
I
wear
Will
it
be
worth
leaving
the
house
What
will
it
be
like
what
will
it
feel
like
to
be
there
What
kind
of
energy
are
we
bringing
I
love
your
vibe
a
girl
told
me
last
summer
in
the
restroom
of
a
bar
in
Cambridge
Massachusetts
I
never
asked
but
I
immediately
wondered
What
is
my
vibe
Try-hard
woman
on
a
date
Exhausted
graduate
student
Pandemic
shut-in
wondering
when
she
can
go
home
What
are
you
getting
from
me
This
reading
list
picks
up
the
question
I
never
asked
What
is
the
vibe
after
all
Short
for
vibration
the
vibe
is
largely
intangible
It
s
more
than
a
feeling
less
than
a
fact
A
vibe
can
be
manufactured
but
also
alterable
to
an
extent
The
vibe
can
change
The
vibe
can
suddenly
be
off
There
are
good
vibes
bad
vibes
and
just
plain
old
vibes
It
can
be
collective
thought
we
vibing
or
the
absence
of
thinking
no
thoughts
just
vibes
can
be
intensely
personal
I
love
her
vibe
or
atmospheric
feeling
caught
a
vibe
And
now
infamously
the
vibe
can
shift
too
In
The
Cut
Allison
P
Davis
wrote
that
a
vibe
shift
is
coming
borrowing
entrepreneur
Sean
Monahan
s
language
to
describe
eras
where
something
suddenly
seems
hopelessly
outdated
It
s
mostly
about
fashion
a
little
bit
about
lifestyle
Davis
imagines
that
next
vibe
shift
might
be
the
return
of
early
aughts
clothing
but
she
wonders
if
she
will
survive
it
Inflected
by
two
years
of
her
prime
spent
in
the
throes
of
a
pandemic
Davis
wonders
Do
I
try
to
opt
in
to
whatever
trend
comes
next
or
do
I
choose
to
accept
that
my
last
two
good
years
were
spent
on
my
couch
gobbling
antidepressants
and
wearing
‘
cute
house
pants
and
UGGs
In
The
Lore
Zone
Libby
Marrs
and
Tiger
Dingsun
posit
the
form
of
the
phrase
vibe
shift
as
a
linguistic
artifact
of
a
community
s
internal
world
and
its
subsequent
misreading
in
the
hands
of
the
digital
public
The
vibe
shift
is
a
misreading
of
a
term
that
earlier
internet
communities
used
first
and
differently
The
vibe
here
is
amorphous
and
intangible
It
is
manifested
through
clothes
and
accessories
and
life
lived
through
material
talismans
People
who
don
t
adapt
get
left
behind
The
ones
still
clinging
to
authenticity
and
fairy
lights
are
the
ones
who
crystallized
in
their
hipsterdom
while
the
culture
moved
on
They
‘
bunkered
down
in
Greenpoint
and
got
married
or
took
their
waxed
beards
and
nautical
tattoo
sleeves
and
relocated
to
Hudson
But
the
concept
of
the
vibe
what
it
names
how
it
means
something
why
we
use
it
is
so
much
larger
than
the
concept
that
a
vibe
shift
imagines
The
vibe
is
so
much
more
than
just
what
clothes
are
cool
or
what
cocktails
are
cute
to
order
or
what
this
year
s
hot
girl
summer
will
look
like
The
pieces
on
this
list
imagine
what
vibes
are
but
just
as
much
they
chart
a
sort
of
central
absence
in
our
terminology
The
diffuse
nature
of
the
vibe
makes
writing
about
its
contours
extremely
challenging
yet
the
writers
on
this
list
do
so
in
vivid
ways
imagining
which
aspects
of
our
lives
make
the
language
of
vibes
so
appealing
forms
of
being
online
social
presence
changed
in
the
wake
of
the
pandemic
capitalism
and
its
strictures
structures
of
knowing
what
we
know
and
living
how
we
live
In
the
hands
of
the
writers
on
this
list
the
vibe
comes
into
clearer
focus
The
vibe
has
style
and
form
it
has
a
history
and
a
theory
it
has
lovers
and
haters
The
vibe
is
a
deeply
digital
and
contemporary
phenomenon
and
Kyle
Chayka
turns
to
the
vibe
videos
of
TikTok
to
consider
how
social
media
and
TikTok
in
particular
is
responsible
for
the
vibes
revival
of
the
2020s
TikTok
s
visual
platform
the
montage
of
images
strung
together
is
perfectly
equipped
to
deal
with
the
affects
and
feelings
of
a
vibe
favoring
aesthetics
over
narrative
Vibes
can
be
curated
but
they
can
also
be
made
What
I
find
most
exciting
about
Chayka
s
comment
is
that
he
notes
the
two-way
street
between
vibes
and
the
world
The
TikTok
vibe
determines
real
life
just
as
much
as
real
life
determines
the
vibe
Vibes
are
a
medium
for
feeling
the
kind
of
abstract
understanding
that
comes
before
words
put
a
name
to
experience
That
pre-linguistic
quality
makes
them
well
suited
to
a
social-media
landscape
that
is
increasingly
prioritizing
audio
video
and
images
over
text
Through
our
screens
vibes
are
being
constantly
emitted
and
received
If
this
list
imagines
what
vibes
are
and
are
not
Mitch
Therieau
s
essay
in
The
Drift
is
a
masterful
attempt
to
catalog
how
words
like
vibe
mood
and
energy
first
emerged
as
countercultural
terms
and
are
reemerging
in
an
era
not
of
plenty
but
of
little
In
this
time
of
austerity
of
climate
change
and
loan
repayments
and
a
sweeping
pandemic
what
do
the
concepts
of
vibe
mood
and
energy
offer
us
These
terms
give
shape
to
our
feelings
and
desires
yet
Therieau
carefully
argues
that
these
terms
don
t
point
us
to
a
better
world
so
much
as
giving
us
vocabulary
to
keep
living
where
we
are
now
The
vibe
A
survival
technique
The
objects
of
derision
for
the
counterculture
have
reversed
polarity
and
become
objects
of
desire
of
hope
against
hope
If
only
we
could
maybe
we
can
once
again
don
the
gray
flannel
suit
even
if
just
for
a
few
years
to
pay
back
our
student
loans
This
longing
for
normalcy
plays
a
faint
counterpoint
to
a
steady
background
hum
of
no
future
no
future
no
future
All
the
more
surprising
then
to
see
vibe/mood/energy
that
utopian
countercultural
triad
reemerge
in
recent
years
It
is
the
puzzle
of
the
resurrection
of
a
boom-time
form
in
a
bust
time
A
bust
time
no
less
when
words
of
magic
are
no
longer
unambiguously
on
the
side
of
rebellion
resistance
vitality
when
they
are
wielded
by
the
platform
and
the
individual
alike
I
love
this
Substack
newsletter
by
Mary
Retta
where
she
thinks
through
vibing
as
an
antidote
to
capitalist
time
Vibing
for
Retta
is
a
way
of
resisting
the
grindset
the
constant
self-improvement
plan
of
the
contemporary
moment
one
that
was
particularly
exacerbated
by
the
beginning
of
the
pandemic
Vibes
for
her
are
a
presence
of
an
absence
not
an
absence
of
presence
to
be
just
vibing
is
to
be
doing
something
something
amorphous
something
shimmering
off
the
edge
of
the
capitalist
framework
that
orders
our
experience
of
time
This
notion
of
time
as
an
economic
resource
is
exactly
what
vibing
aims
to
break
away
from
It
is
not
a
coincidence
that
the
last
year
has
brought
both
the
collapse
of
capitalism
and
an
upending
of
time
This
year
of
stillness
and
retreat
has
made
it
plain
that
time
is
not
an
empty
thing
we
have
to
fill
but
a
living
thing
that
we
must
shape
Time
changes
Because
the
world
changes
and
we
change
with
it
To
vibe
is
to
shape
time
into
pleasure
to
mold
it
into
something
that
feels
soft
and
tastes
sweet
It
is
to
take
a
pause
that
bleeds
into
another
Until
finally
writes
Githere
the
space
between
the
dream
and
the
memory
collapses
into
being
your
reality—now
In
an
interview
Grietzer
notes
Learning
vibes
is
crucial
for
all
kinds
of
knowledge-how
but
it
s
a
slow
long
process
and
communicating
learned
vibes
to
each
other
is
a
problem
a
vibe
has
the
structure
of
a
trained
autoencoder
which
is
mathematically
and
conceptually
intractable
The
vibe
eludes
us
but
only
to
an
extent
So
how
do
we
know
a
vibe
Peli
Grietzer
turns
to
math-informed
literary
theory
autoencoders
a
type
of
neural
network
to
name
a
theory
of
vibe
in
Modernist
writing
and
in
general
The
vibe
like
style
has
a
structure
that
can
be
studied
not
so
amorphous
or
immaterial
as
it
may
seem
The
aesthetics
of
the
vibe
considered
in
writing
through
these
mathematical
terms
has
a
kind
of
logic
one
that
helps
us
conceptualize
the
kind
of
knowing
we
do
when
we
know
the
vibe
While
the
specifics
of
Grietzer
s
mathematical
model
might
elude
me
I
appreciate
the
fundamental
logic
of
his
claim
The
vibe
is
mappable
in
its
meaning-making
We
can
see
it
track
it
make
some
kind
of
sense
out
of
it
and
where
better
to
start
than
literature
The
meaning
of
a
literary
work
like
Dante
s
Inferno
Beckett
s
Waiting
for
Godot
or
Stein
s
Tender
Buttons
we
would
like
to
say
lies
at
least
partly
in
an
aesthetic
‘
vibe
or
a
‘
style
that
we
can
sense
when
we
consider
all
the
myriad
objects
and
phenomena
that
make
up
the
imaginative
landscape
of
the
work
as
a
kind
of
curated
set
The
meaning
of
Dante
s
Inferno
let
us
say
lies
in
part
in
that
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
that
makes
every
soul
demon
and
machine
in
Dante
s
vision
of
hell
a
good
fit
for
Dante
s
vision
of
hell
Similarly
the
meaning
of
Beckett
s
Waiting
for
Godot
lies
partly
in
what
limits
our
space
of
thinkable
things
for
Vladimir
and
Estragon
to
say
and
do
to
a
small
set
of
possibilities
the
play
nearly
exhausts
Part
of
the
meaning
of
Stein
s
Tender
Buttons
lies
in
the
set
of
possibly
inherently
linguistic
‘
tender
buttons
—conforming
objects
and
phenomena
The
vibe
is
a
mood
but
it
s
never
only
a
mood
it
s
also
a
model
In
her
Substack
newsletter
philosopher
Robin
James
writes
on
the
vibe
as
the
horizon
of
contemporary
finance
capitalism
If
speculative
finance
uses
the
intangibility
of
vibes
as
a
way
of
disciplining
and
orienting
us
to
the
world
the
vibe
might
not
be
as
liberatory
as
other
writers
imagine
The
vibe
might
after
all
amplify
frequencies
that
we
might
rather
go
quiet
This
is
exactly
what
I
find
compelling
about
James
work
with
the
vibe
as
a
scholar
of
sound
studies
her
attention
to
the
musical
valences
of
the
vibe
its
resonance
and
frequency
remind
us
of
where
the
concept
of
vibe
started
as
vibration
As
a
being
and
falling
in
line
orientation
isn
t
disciplinary
conformity
to
a
norm
but
a
directionality
or
course
or
tendency
to
have
capacities
that
will
contribute
positively
to
the
reproduction
of
hegemonic
society
Orientation
is
having
the
capacities
to
augment
the
capacities
of
the
world
that
oriented
you
and
that
you
in
turn
orient
building
wealth/capacity
that
can
pay
forward
what
has
been
invested
in
you
In
other
words
being
oriented
means
having
a
vibe
that
is
sufficiently
attuned
to
our
white
supremacist
capitalist
patriarchal
world
to
induce
and
amplify
sympathetic
resonances
with
it

Even
those
detached
from
the
world
of
college
sports
remember
how
Penn
State
s
legendary
football
program
crumbled
at
least
reputationally
under
the
weight
of
assistant
coach
Jerry
Sandusky
s
horrific
sexual
abuse
of
young
boys
However
as
Lavigne
and
Junod
chronicle
in
this
sprawling
compulsively
readable
investigation
it
wasn
t
the
first
time
a
monster
found
some
measure
of
protection
in
the
organization
After
a
young
linebacker
named
Todd
Hodne
was
arrested
for
rape
in
1978
head
coach
Joe
Paterno
kicked
him
off
the
team
yet
Hodne
would
go
on
to
strike
again
and
again
enabled
in
part
by
the
culture
of
deification
that
surrounded
the
Nittany
Lions
The
story
of
Hodne
indeed
the
story
of
the
women
whose
lives
he
disrupted
and
destroyed
over
multiple
years
in
multiple
states
some
of
whom
broke
decades-long
silence
spills
over
the
lines
of
magazine
story
into
something
altogether
different
It
s
a
testament
to
survival
To
living
through
atrocity
and
coming
out
the
other
side
And
through
its

I
grew
up
two
hours
south
of
the
Great
Dismal
Swamp
and
I
know
virtually
nothing
about
it
except
its
name
There
s
a
reason
for
that
The
Dismal
as
it
s
known
has
long
been
dismissed
by
the
gatekeepers
of
American
history
as
a
place
where
history
simply
doesn
t
happen
As
Lex
Pryor
reveals
in
this
elegant
haunting
essay
people
with
ancestral
ties
to
the
Dismal
are
working
to
change
that
to
memorialize
the
slaves
who
once
toiled
in
the
swamp
and
the
runaways
who
found
refuge
in
it
In
a
nation
whose
every
territory
is
drenched
in
overlapping
legacies
of
violence
and
erasure
the
Dismal
stands
as
a
most
American
tangle
Pryor
writes
It
is
scarred
And
yet
it
is
anointed
Next
time
I
drive
home
to
see
family
I
ll
be
stopping
at
the
Dismal
to
pay
my
respects

The

from

a

themselves
a
world
that
s

a
scene
that
looks
nothing

today

I
ve
read
many
versions
of
this
journey
and
have
written
my
own
but
I
never
tire
of
reading
them
Those
first
moments
of
discovery
of
wonder
that
at
times
borders
on
fear
of
ecstasy
in
the
wee
hours
and
then
after
you
ve
crawled
out
into
the
bright
daylight
a
transformative
aftermath
that
for
some
doesn

really
end
I
love
writing
that
explores
the
mental-physical
awareness
that
creeps
up
on
people
as
they
discover
the
power
and
swiftness
of
their
own
bodies
when
dancing
and
how
Graham
describes
how
he
eventually
harnesses
the
otherworldly
sounds
at
a
party
the
track
unleashed
a
creature
inside
me
and
time
disappeared
and
becomes
less
afraid
of
this
darkness
over
time
He
later
encounters
the
underground
rave
scene
abroad
notably
the
Freetekno
movement
in
Vienna
and
meets
partiers
who
ve
taken
the
origins
of
raving
to
an
extreme
For
these
people
there
is
no
underground
from
which
to
resurface
no
normal
world
to
rejoin

was

By

Every
spring
there
is
a
moment
when
I
am
overcome
by
the
scent
of
the
new
season
Sometimes
I
m
outside
sometimes
it
floats
in
on
a
breeze
through
windows
thrown
wide
open
but
wherever
I
am
I
stop
shut
my
eyes
and
inhale
Spring
smells
the
same
every
year
and
that
scent
is
sharpest
when
the
season
is
new
before
the
smell
grows
familiar
and
is
relegated
to
background
noise
This
kind
of
experience
isn
t
unique
to
spring
Every
season
has
its
own
scent
The
musty
wet
decay
of
fall
The
ozonic
crispness
of
the
first
snowfall
The
sharp
green
of
freshly
cut
grass
Sometimes
I
ll
catch
a
scent
that
evokes
something
I
can
t
quite
grasp
I
only
know
that
it
is
familiar
Whatever
experience
attached
to
it
lodged
too
deeply
in
my
memory
bank
to
be
accessible
In
these
instances
I
find
myself
chasing
after
the
smell
like
Proust
with
his
tea-drenched
madeleine
trying
to
both
identify
the
scent
and
hold
on
to
the
sensation
it
inspired
Our
sense
of
smell
has
such
a
powerful
link
to
memory
that
it
will
recall
even
these
incomplete
moments
in
which
we
re
sure
of
nothing
except
that
we
ve
smelled
that
aroma
before
Despite
its
power
smell
remains
the
least
understood
of
our
senses
Dismissed
by
Enlightenment-era
philosophers
like
Kant
as
our
least
intellectual
by
virtue
of
being
the
one
that
ties
us
most
closely
with
animals
our
sense
of
smell
wasn
t
considered
worthy
of
study
in
the
past
Now
that
appears
to
be
changing
We
have
a
renewed
interest
in
this
most
mysterious
of
our
five
senses
Books
like
Avery

the
science
of
smell
in

A
developing
frontier
in
virtual
reality
technology
is
to
make
the
experience
more
immersive
by
adding
scent
With
COVID
causing
anosmia
the
loss
of
smell
in
many
people
sometimes
for
months
at
a
time
for
some
maybe
even
permanently
it
s
no
wonder
we
ve
gained
a
new
appreciation
for
this
forgotten
sense
Having
contracted
COVID
while
writing
this
I
find
myself
taking
deep
inhales
of
anything
heavily
scented
even
more
obsessively
than
usual
to
reassure
myself
that
I
haven
t
been
affected
by
this
particular
symptom
Last
January
after
our
first
pandemic
Christmas
I
purchased
a
sample
set
of
perfumes
from
niche
perfumery
Imaginary
Authors
quaintly
named
for
the
fictional
personalities
that
inspire
each
fragrance
Their
sample
set
is
aptly
named
the
Short
Story
Collection
What
began
as
mere
curiosity
spiraled
into
an
obsession
and
I
have
since
accumulated
a
shelf
of
books
on
the
topic
of
smell
alongside
an
ever-growing
collection
of
perfume
samples
This
reading
list
explores
the
many
facets
of
scent
from
the
science
of
how
we
smell
to
the
link
between
scent
and
attraction
but
consistent
among
them
all
is
an
enamored
fascination
with
how
we
perceive
the
world
through
our
noses
If
you
re
a
Twitter
fraghead
a
term
for
a
perfume
aficionado
you
might
be
familiar
with
Rachel
Syme
and
her
perfume
genie
She
gives
her
followers
a
prompt
such
as
relating
a
specific
memory
where
you
felt
truly
happy
and
she
responds
with
a
perfume
to
match
It
s
probably
my
favorite
thing
on
the
internet
not
just
for
the
discovery
of
new
perfumes
but
for
the
surprisingly
beautiful
writing
that
these
prompts
inspire
In
this
article
Syme
invites
you
into
her
lifelong
obsession
with
scent
by
teasing
out
all
the
strangeness
of
our
sense
of
smell
the
difficulty
of
describing
fragrances
the
way
the
acceptability
of
an
odor
changes
between
cultures
and
contexts
and
the
constant
human
practice
of
altering
our
olfactive
environments
Our
own
experience
confirms
that
smells
are
subject
not
just
to
major
cultural
changes
but
also
to
minor
shifts
in
context
the
same
smell
that
greets
you
at
the
door
of
a
cheesemonger
has
a
very
different
effect
when
confronted
at
the
door
of
a
porta-potty
Where
McGee
seeks
a
common
vocabulary
for
exploring
the
osmocosm
Muchembled
reminds
us
that
the
variables
of
time
and
place
may
defy
a
truly
shared
language
What
we
smell
depends
on
what
s
in
vogue
and
what
s
valued—on
what
cultural
forces
happen
to
be
swirling
in
the
air
Laura
Yan
writes
about
the
need
to
move
away
from
the
term
oriental
in
perfume
sales
for
MIC
Something
that
often
gets
left
out
of
conversations
about
Western
perfumery
is
its
inextricable
ties
to
colonialism
The
European
quest
for
spices
is
well
known
but
the
other
side
of
this
quest
was
a
desire
for
so-called
exotic
fragrant
materials
It
s
a
history
that
reverberates
well
into
the
perfumery
of
today
most
evidently
in
the
persistent
use
of
the
term
oriental
as
a
fragrance
category
Tanaïs
grapples
with
these
ties
alongside
her
own
history
cultural
personal
and
familial
with
perfume
For
Tanaïs
both
fiction
writing
and
perfume
are
ways
to
escape
material
borders
Both
offer
a
mode
of
expression
and
a
way
of
understanding
the
world
If
you
enjoy
this
essay
be
sure
to
read
Tanaïs
recently
published
memoir
In
Sensorium
Notes
for
My
People
Nanu
s
tastes
were
village
girl
through
and
through
she
loved
a
bright
red
lip
and
attar
of
jasmine
a
narcotic
floral
with
an
animal
stink
I
trace
its
scent
back
to
a
memory
of
having
pneumonia
as
a
kid
One
morning
when
I
couldn
t
stop
throwing
up
bitter
medicine
Nanu
dipped
a
pair
of
cotton
balls
in
her
jasmine
attar
and
tucked
them
into
my
ears
I
lay
with
my
head
on
her
lap
until
the
scent
lulled
me
to
sleep
Whereas
a
body
can
not
escape
circumstance—in
my
grandmother
s
case
she
married
at
13
did
not
finish
school
and
lost
her
son
and
husband
at
a
young
age—a
perfume
lets
us
do
so
if
only
for
a
moment
In
one
breath
I
experienced
illness
relief
love
and
history
A
single
olfactory
moment
distills
a
myriad
emotions
and
experiences
just
as
one
line
can
illuminate
an
entire
story
Anyone
who
s
ever
found
an
intimate
partner
s
body
odor
appealing
shouldn
t
be
too
surprised
to
find
that
human
sexual
or
romantic
compatibility
can
be
determined
through
the
smell
of
our
sweat
Sarah
Everts
tests
this
theory
firsthand
by
attending
a
smell
dating
event
in
Moscow
where
participants
are
matched
based
on
how
much
they
like
each
other
s
stench
Participants
wipe
their
sweaty
pits
with
a
cotton
pad
deposit
it
into
a
numbered
jar
and
proceed
to
smell
each
one
before
submitting
their
top
five
Matches
are
made
between
people
who
pick
each
other
s
scent
regardless
of
gender
or
sexual
orientation
If
that
s
not
enough
to
pique
your
curiosity
Everts
also
offers
some
insight
into
the
surprising
power
of
the
human
nose
and
the
ways
in
which
we
use
our
sense
of
smell
to
suss
out
other
humans
even
when
we
don
t
realize
it
You
ll
find
yourself
wondering
about
your
own
handshaking
behavior
after
this
I
haven
t
been
able
to
stop
thinking
about
it
I
note
the
numbers
of
a
few
samples
that
I
m
on
the
fence
about
because
I
ve
got
to
give
the
organizers
a
list
of
my
five
favorites
And
then
I
hit
jar
fifteen
It
smells
to
me
like
sex
epitomized
When
I
sniff
again
trying
to
tease
apart
the
aroma
profile
I
can
detect
the
standard
goaty
oniony
background
odours
of
another
human
very
similar
to
all
the
other
samples
But
something
in
that
mix
made
me
want
to
sniff
again
ASAP
The
odour
didn
t
send
me
into
an
erotic
paroxysm
but
it
was
fundamentally
appealing
it
triggered
an
instant
reminder
that
there
s
this
great
activity
one
can
engage
in
with
another
person
and
it
s
called
sex
Chavie
Lieber
also
writes
for
Vox
about
the
move
towards
AI
in
developing
new
perfumes
We
begin
in
Grasse
the
historical
capital
of
perfumery
with
legendary
perfumer
Jean
Carles
Carles
is
famous
not
only
for
creating
iconic
fragrances
such
as
Ma
Griffe
and
Miss
Dior
but
for
bringing
some
method
to
the
haphazard
madness
of
composing
perfumes
which
used
to
rely
primarily
on
happy
accidents
Still
as
Scott
Sayare
points
out
His
taxonomy
could
not
say
what
formulas
would
actually
smell
good
or
why
At
best
it
could
help
to
organize
the
process
of
trial
and
error
that
would
inevitably
precede
the
discovery
of
one
that
did
Decades
later
the
top
players
in
the
flavor
and
fragrance
industry
are
still
attempting
to
streamline
the
process
of
scent
composition
It
s
a
$
30
billion-a-year
industry
developing
new
perfume
ingredients
at
the
molecular
level
for
everything
from
high-end
perfumes
to
the
cardboard
air
fresheners
you
hang
on
your
car
s
rearview
mirror
The
latest
development
in
the
science
of
fragrance
creation
appears
in
the
form
of
AI
programs
that
will
compose
scents
under
specific
parameters
But
while
we
ve
come
a
long
way
since
Jean
Carles
developed
his
method
there
remains
a
level
of
guesswork
in
creating
fragrances
reflecting
our
limited
knowledge
of
how
smell
works
At
the
very
top
of
the
nasal
cavity
up
between
the
eyes
sits
mucosal
tissue
known
as
the
olfactory
epithelium
It
is
dense
with
neurons
and
embedded
in
these
neurons
are
proteins
known
as
odorant
receptors
Odorant
receptors
bind
the
volatile
compounds
we
inhale
converting
them
into
electric
signals
that
will
eventually
register
in
our
consciousness
as
smell
The
nature
of
these
receptors—how
many
kinds
there
are
which
molecules
they
respond
to—is
central
to
our
experience
of
scent
It
is
also
for
the
most
part
a
mystery
It
s
nearly
impossible
to
write
about
smell
these
days
without
also
writing
about
COVID-19
because
of
one
distinct
symptom
the
loss
of
smell
In
this
conversation
with
Montreal-based
perfumer
Dana
El
Masri
Sarah
Laing
discusses
the
many
ways
COVID
has
affected
the
way
we
relate
to
smell
This
goes
beyond
our
increased
awareness
of
it
as
we
monitor
ourselves
for
symptoms
moving
back
out
into
the
world
the
strong
connection
between
smell
and
memory
will
affect
how
we
perceive
the
odor
of
sanitized
spaces
potentially
shifting
our
association
from
one
of
safety
and
comfort
to
one
of
anxiety
and
paranoia
But
it
s
not
all

El
Masri
also
speaks
of
perfume
as
a
mood
booster
I
noticed
people
would
buy
perfume
as
this
small
pleasure
to
bring
them
joy
during
this
time
As
someone
who
regularly
dons
a
spritz
of
El
Masri
s
Neon
Graffiti
I
can
attest
to
the
effectiveness
of
this
practice
The
blast
of
fizzy
citrus
and
sharp
green
leafiness
that
mellows
into
a
sweetened
jasmine
heart
brings
to
mind
the
first
warm
days
of
spring
and
offers
an
escape
from
pandemic
drudgery
Most
of
our
interactions
these
days
are
virtual
meaning
we
re
missing
out
on
olfactory
cues
that
we
ve
been
subconsciously
leaning
on
all
our
lives
It
s
yet
another
reason
why
Zoom
meetings
feel
deeply
unsatisfying—and
why
they
re
so
exhausting
as
your
other
senses
try
to
make
up
for
that
information
deficit
We
smell
with
our
brain
says
El
Masri
noting
that
the
brain
processes
smell
memory
and
emotion
in
the
same
area
known
as
the
amygdala
The
nose
is
a
tool
and
there
s
a
reason
it
s
in
the
middle
of
our
face
If
smell
is
central
to
how
we
relate
to
other
people
whether
or
not
we
re
aware
of
it
then
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
pandemic
has
altered
our
interactions
with
one
another
on
a
far
deeper
level
than
we
may
have
realized
Laura
Regensdorf
wonders
about
the
effect
not
just
of
anosmia
which
has
been
linked
to
depression
and
lowered
quality
of
life
but
of
our
now-limited
chance
encounters
and
the
way
our
sense
of
smells
dulls
to
what
is
familiar
You
re
unlikely
to
bury
your
nose
in
a
lover
s
perfume-tinged
scarf
or
armpit
if
you
ve
eaten
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
with
her
she
reasons
This
flattening
of
the
sensory
landscape
might
add
to
a
feeling
of
monotony
a
dullness
of
desire
The
solution
Perhaps
it
s
found
in
a
new
perfume
Perfume
is
difficult
to
pin
down
In
the
case
of
Spell
on
You
my
imperfect
nose
only
recently
liberated
from
chronic
allergies
catches
a
hint
of
Haribo
peach
that
softens
into
a
moody
rose—practically
begging
for
a
hotel
bathrobe
My
boyfriend
after
sniffing
unbidden
at
my
head
told
me
I
smelled
as
if
a
fancy
lady
sent
you
a
note
card
The
comments
section
on
the
fragrance
website
Fragrantica
swings
from
pronouncing
it
a
summery
nonchalant
chef
d
oeuvre
to
something
surprisingly
demure
given
the
name
You
could
easily
wear
this
at
the
office
or
as
a
clerk
wanting
to
smell
well-groomed
but
nothing
too
noticeable
the
person
writes
with
a
twinge
of
disappointment
But
isn
t
there
subversion
in
cosplaying
a
prim
stereotype
rule-abiding
here
something-something
there

Noy
Thrupkaew
reports
for
The
Washington
Post
on
the
latest
development
in
restricted
perfume
ingredients
The
perfume
industry
is
constantly
changing
sometimes
to
keep
up
with
shifting
trends
and
sometimes
because
it
has
to
contend
with
restrictions
on
ingredients
These
restrictions
regulated
by
the
International
Fragrance
Association
IFRA
and
influenced
by
the
much
stricter
EU
have
caused
an
uproar
among
perfumers
especially
where
oakmoss
is
concerned
Oakmoss
provides
the
base
for
two
major
perfume
types
chypre
and
fougére
and
without
it
a
fragrance
changes
substantially
Courtney
Humphries
dives
into
the
complex
world
of
fine
fragrance
design
and
outlines
the
challenges
faced
by
perfumers
as
they
contend
with
losing
some
of
the
building
blocks
of
classic
perfumery
Though
this
article
is
a
decade
old
the
debate
around
oakmoss
and
other
restricted
or
outright
banned
ingredients
rages
on
Some
perfumers
have
adapted
to
these
restrictions
reformulating
their
fragrances
with
synthetic
replacements
or
finding
new
combinations
of
ingredients
to
achieve
a
similar
olfactive
effect
Others
like
perfume
writer
Luca
Turin
have
a
more
drastic
opinion
asserting
that
such
restrictions
render
the
art
of
fragrance
officially
dead
Although
IFRA
restrictions
affect
both
natural
and
synthetic
ingredients
they
pose
a
particular
problem
for
the
natural
ingredients
which
can
t
simply
be
tweaked
at
the
molecular
level
to
make
new
compounds
with
almost
identical
scents
For
example
IFRA
limits
levels
of
methyl
eugenol
a
chemical
component
of
many
natural
materials
because
it
was
found
to
act
as
a
carcinogen
in
rodents
Not
only
is
methyl
eugenol
a
component
of
rose
oil
one
of
perfumery
s
most
prized
ingredients
it
is
also
found
in
spices
such
as
clove
and
pimenta
berry
The
amount
of
methyl
eugenol
in
a
perfume
must
be
controlled
across
its
entire
formula
so
one
material
that
contains
it
may
have
to
be
sacrificed
for
others
To
replace
a
natural
ingredient
that
traditionally
has
contained
methyl
eugenol
makers
like
Mane
have
to
return
to
the
raw
materials
trying
to
find
a
new
means
of
extraction
whose
result
complies
with
the
rules

I
once
saw
Britney
Spears
at
Jerry
s
Deli
in
Westwood
I
was
20
and
the
two
of
us
were
in
line
for
the
bathroom
I
can
not
tell
you
a
single
detail
about
what
she
was
wearing
the
expression
on
her
face
or
how
tall
she
seemed
My
brain
could
only
process
two
things
the
jolt
of
recognition
at
beholding
a
celebrity
who
had
defined
pop
culture
during
my
adolescence
and
her
golden
blonde
hair
which
made
her
look
like
a
whole
sunbeam
a
glowing
flashbulb
too
bright
to
stare
at
too
closely
I
had
been
lightening
my
own
hair
since
age
14
first
with
sprays
of
Sun
In
and
later
sitting
in
a
salon
chair
on
Melrose
Avenue
while
a
stylist
dabbed
bleach
on
sections
and
folded
them
into
foils
I
flipped
through
Cosmo
and
People
as
the
color
processed
looking
at
photos
of
blonde
celebrities
women
like
Holly
Madison
and
Jessica
Simpson
imitating
the
style
of
women
like
Marilyn
Monroe
and
Jayne
Mansfield
all
of
us
in
the
Baudrillardian
sense
copies
of
copies
of
copies
Hollywood
blondes
never
really
go
out
of
fashion
they
only
shapeshift
to
meet
the
psychic
and
aesthetic
needs
of
each
generation
Our
current
moment
has
us
revisiting
an
array
of
platinum
icons
from
both
the
distant
and
more
recent
past
Documentaries
podcasts
and
television
shows
about
figures
from
Traci
Lords
to
Pamela
Anderson
attempt
to
tease
truth
from
artifice
and
interrogate
the
figure
of
the
bimbo
more
broadly
to
varying
degrees
of
success
The
best
of
these
projects
rehabilitate
the
Hollywood
blonde
who
has
been
historically
maligned
as
a
ditz
or
a
slut
without
necessarily
rewriting
her
as
a
legible
feminist
in
the
modern
sense
Essayists
and
journalists
anticipated
this
trend
starting
a
few
years
ago
Some
gave
us
dark
fables
of
doomed
blondes
thrown
upon
the
merciless
gears
and
levers
of
the
show
business
machine
Others
wrote
triumphant
American
stories
of
metamorphosis
of
the
second
act
of
the
potent
mingling
of
beauty
with
commerce
Part
of
the
fun
of
reading
about
Hollywood
blondes
is
immersing
oneself
in
the
language
of
glamour
sex
fantasy
and
occasionally
transgression
The
pieces
on
this
list
explore
themes
of
eroticized
stupidity
feminine
excess
and
the
crafting
of
public
personas
Like
their
subjects
they
seduce
and
confound
Marilyn
Monroe
s
iconography
includes
the
infamous
Playboy
nudes
the
billowing
white
dress
from
The
Seven

Itch
and

photographs
of
the
actress
posed
with
open
books
like
Walt
Whitman
s
Leaves
of
Grass
What
to
make
of
the
pictures
of
Marilyn
reading
They
suggest
a
depth
and
intelligence
starkly
opposed
by
the
image
of
her
in
our
popular
imagination
the
breathy
empty-headed
sexpot
whose
body
telegraphed
post-war
desire
Like
Whitman
she
contained
multitudes
In
1955
she
broke
her
20th
Century
Fox
contract
and
settled
into
a
community
of
Jewish
New
York
intellectuals
while
the
FBI
kept
tabs
on
her
leftist
politics
Audrey
Wollen
s
essay
explores
this
paradox
describing
Marilyn
s
passage
from
pop
culture
to
high
culture
She
fled
the
castle
or
she
kept
conquering
territory
depending
on
who
you
ask
From
the
height
of
Hollywood
she
went
to
the
theatrical
stage
from
the
beloved
baseball
star
she
went
to
the
acerbic
playwright
from
the
front
page
tell-all
interview
she
went
to
the
psychoanalytic
couch
The
press
the
public
and
the
studios
all
thought
she
had
gone
crazy
In
the
United
States
in
1955
and
now
nothing
screams
insanity
like
shacking
up
with
a
Marxist
believing
Freud
and
reading
Dostoevsky

of

s

backstory
until

research
revealed
she
was
born
Ronia
Tamar
Goldberg
the
Polish
Jewish
daughter
of
Holocaust
survivors
Making
the
most
of
Tinseltown
s
penchant
for
reinvention
and
self-mythology
she
donned
full
shiksa
drag
Goldberg
had
purely
committed
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
Hollywood
escapism
by
inhabiting
the
character
she
conjured
to
the
point
of
no
return
Like
many
dreamers
she
adopted
a
stage
name
and
altered
her
body
and
behavior
to
better
position
a
prospective
entertainment
career
that
like

never
panned
out
quite
as
intended

For
another
take
on
the
concept
of
the
bimbo
read
Alana
Levinson
s
Justice
for
the
Bimbo
The
Cut
2022
Not
all
blondes
are
bimbos
and
not
all
bimbos
are
blondes
but
the
two
are
often
linked
during
the
90s
a
wave
of
dumb
blonde
jokes
cemented
the
stereotype
in
our
collective
consciousness
These
days
the
bimbo
hair
color
and
even
gender
notwithstanding
has
been
enjoying
something
of
a
renaissance
among
TikTok
zoomers
drawn
to
fluffy
frivolity
during
what
increasingly
feels
like
the
end
times
The
bimbo
is
sugar-sweet
but
not
altogether
guileless
as
Elle
Woods
proved
at
Harvard
Law
and
to
fret
that
she
caters
to
the
Male
Gaze
now
reads
as
hopelessly
second-wave
In
2022
we
can
walk
and
snap
our
bubblegum
at
the
same
time
Historically
speaking
the
archetypal
bimbo
is
enthusiastic
and
good-natured
Bimboism
does
not
necessarily
require
passivity
it
is
just
not
in
the
bimbo
to
be
cruel
She
only
punches
up
She
pursues
hyper-femininity
to
the
extreme—at
times
to
the
point
of
drag
She
s
glossy
voluminous
and
kind
The
bimbo
counters
the
assumption
that
we
would
opt
out
of
femininity
if
we
could
in
fact
she
embraces
it
Ultimately
the
desire
to
absorb
the
identity
of
the
bimbo
comes
from
the
fact
the
bimbo
is
unburdened—whether
or
not
this
is
a
performance
Her
respite
is
covetable
especially
when
the
internet
often
feels
like
it
lives
in
the
grips
of
irascible
snark

her
humble
class
background

its
attendant
signifiers
in
the
eyes
of
Americans
who
deemed
her
white
trash
She
elicited
that
combustible
alchemy
of
fascination
and
revulsion
that
makes
a
woman
perfect
tabloid
and
reality
TV
fodder
But
it
was
Smith
s
status
as
an
unrepentant
gold-digger
that
cast
her
tragic
downfall
as
the
just
desserts
for
her
larger-than-life
appetites
The
woman
rose
up
made
powerful
by
beauty
and
then
found
herself
falling
her
beauty
fading
her
power
eroding
her
ugliness
as
she
tried
to
cope
with
this
loss
providing
spectators
with
the
reassuring
feeling
that
such
power
is
never
really
worth
having
if
losing
it
looks
like
this
And
the
only
person
more
deserving
of
this
humiliation
than
the
cluelessly
beautiful
woman
is
the
beautiful
woman
who
even
more
unforgivably
knows
she
is
beautiful
the
woman
who
knows
she
is
worth
something
to
the
world
and
leverages
her
value
to
escape
a
life
she
can
no
longer
stand

If
her
look
was

her
dancing

even
better
than
Madonna

She
may
be
best
understood
as
the

successor
to
Elvis
another
poor

If
you
were
a
high
school
girl
at
the
turn
of
the
millennium
Britney
may
have
helped
you
discover
the
frisson
of
performing
sexuality
that
you
didn
t
wholly
mean
oops
and
that
you
could
always
coyly
deny
Above
all
the
pop
star
was
a
study
in
contrasts
Britney
communicated
in
two
ways
She
talked
with
her
mouth
and
what
she
said
was
soft
flat
polite
girlish
self-effacing
devoid
of
nuance
or
interest
or
force
And
she
talked
with
her
body
and
what
she
said
was
assertive
aggressive
teasing
taunting
cruel
verging
on
sadistic
and
full
of
raw
female
power
The
second
voice
was
the
louder
and
more
insistent
and
it
tended
to
drown
out
the
first
though
not
always
and
never
entirely
And
so
the
disparate
elements
that
made
up
Britney
Spears—part
sweetheart
part
rebel
part
angel
part
whore
part
artist
part
exhibitionist—fused
together

I
m
on
a
mission
to
become
human
again
Not
through
good
deeds
being
in
nature
or
communing
with
the
universe
etc
no
for
me
the
single
most
humane
thing
I
felt
that
I
could
do
was
to
get
off
of
social
media
Deleting
accounts
seemed
a
simple
concrete
action
to
take
but
I
found
it
anything
but
I
m
a
freelance
writer
reliant
on
Twitter
for
pitch
calls
as
well
as
the
all-important
Discourse
of
the
Day
While
Instagram
s
main
purpose
appears
to
be
to
make
me
feel
terrible
the
stories
remain
helpful
for
getting
eyes
on
my
writing
While
Facebook
operates
as
my
Rolodex
of
family
and
friends
my
community
bulletin
board
increasingly
the
only
way
to
learn
who
s
still
alive
and
who
s
dead
This
is
known
as
social
lock-in
where
social
networks
monopolize
our
experiences
and
make
it
impossible
to
live
our
lives
outside
of
the
purview
of
the
platform
It
s
also
a
feature
of
surveillance
capitalism
a
term
coined
by
Shoshana
Zuboff
to
showcase
how
capitalism
no
longer
simply
controls
our
purchasing
power
but
manipulates
our
human
behavior
at
scale
Every
search
query
every
post
liked
even
the
amount
of
time
your
eyes
spend
looking
at
a
specific
image
on
your
screen
is
tracked
quantified
and
mined
to
learn
more
about
you
the
decisions
you
make
and
why
That
information
can
then
be
used
against
you
to
sell
you
more
products
to
make
you
more
susceptible
to
suggestions
to
know
things
about
you
before
you
even
know
them
yourself
Thanks
to
social
media
capitalism
doesn
t
just
require
cornering
the
market
on
household
products
powerful
unknown
players
can
now
corner
the
market
on
democracy
for
the
right
price
As
scary
as
surveillance
capitalism
sounds
for
me
the
true
fear
resides
in
my
slow
loss
of
privacy
and
with
it
my
sense
of
sanctuary
I
m
a
librarian
a
notoriously
privacy-obsessed
profession
Librarians
have
always
believed
that
it
is
your
inalienable
right
to
learn
whatever
it
is
you
want
without
fear
of
anyone
looking
over
your
shoulder
We
were
some
of
the
first
to
cry
foul
over
seemingly
small
encroachments
on
digital
privacy
such
as
individual
search
queries
We
like
to
believe
that
our
own
personal
searches
such
as
best
exercises
to
improve
back
posture
are
small
fry
too
insignificant
to
matter
After
all
we
have
nothing
to
hide
But
we
must
look
at
the
big
picture
much
the
same
way
that
surveillance
capitalist
companies
like
Google
do
Our
personal
decisions
about
privacy
are
hardly
private
they
have
always
been
a
public
affair
The
more
we
allow
tech
and
social
media
companies
to
chip
away
at
our
personal
privacy
the
more
they
can
commercialize
our
privacy
at
scale
Everything
even
our
most
interior
sense
of
self
is
for
sale
According
to
Jaron
Lanier
computer
scientist
futurist
and
frequent
tech
critic
deleting
our
social
media
accounts
is
the
most
finely
targeted
way
to
resist
the
insanity
of
our
times
and
it
s
the
only
way
to
regain
our
humanity
in
an
increasingly
inhumane
world
Here
s
some
inspiration
on
going
from
Extremely
Online
to
Extremely
Offline
No
one
understands
the
importance
of
privacy
as
a
public
affair
better
than
Shoshana
Zuboff
Zuboff
is
the
one
person
who
has
been
repeatedly
able
to
clock
the
tech
economy
and
call
it
for
what
it
is
before
the
rest
of
us
even
know
what
we
ve
signed
up
for
Every
time
we
agree
to
the
mass
of
terms
and
conditions
of
a
new
digital
service
with
personalization
read
data
mining
at
its
core
we
ve
agreed
to
what
Zuboff
calls
surveillance
capitalism
Any
time
I
sit
down
to
read
a
piece
by
Shoshana
Zuboff
I
can
expect
it
to
be
engrossing
brilliant
and
frankly
disturbing
and
this
piece
which
is
essentially
a
Cliff
notes
version
of
her
banger
of
a
book
The
Age
of
Surveillance
Capitalism
takes
no
prisoners
The
lesson
is
that
privacy
is
public
it
is
a
collective
good
that
is
logically
and
morally
inseparable
from
the
values
of
human
autonomy
and
self-determination
upon
which
privacy
depends
and
without
which
a
democratic
society
is
unimaginable
…In
the
competition
for
scope
surveillance
capitalists
want
your
home
and
what
you
say
and
do
within
its
walls
They
want
your
car
your
medical
conditions
and
the
shows
you
stream
your
location
as
well
as
all
the
streets
and
buildings
in
your
path
and
all
the
behavior
of
all
the
people
in
your
city
They
want
your
voice
and
what
you
eat
and
what
you
buy
your
children
s
play
time
and
their
schooling
your
brain
waves
and
your
bloodstream
Nothing
is
exempt
I
love
a
good
profile
Especially
one
on
a
person
as
strange
enigmatic
and
offbeat
as
Jaron
Lanier
the
so-called
father
of
virtual
reality
and
according
to
this
piece
the
owner
of
the
world
s
largest
flute
Lanier
wrote
one
of
my
favorite
books
Ten
Arguments
to
Delete
Your
Social
Media
Accounts
Right
Now
a
slim
little
volume
that
contains
just
10
chapters
10
arguments
and
reads
like
a
Buddhist
manual
written
by
the
dreadlocked
Berkeley
hippie
with
a
pan
flute
that
Lanier
is
In
reading
Baron
s
profile
of
him
I
am
reminded
of
my
own
inner
child
Lanier
a
futurist
by
nature
is
one
of
the
more
curious
people
I
ve
come
upon
his
mind
seemingly
unadulterated
by
outside
influence
which
is
why
I
love
this
profile
showing
the
weird
wily
human
he
is
Lanier
seemed
to
live
somewhere
off
ahead
of
us
by
the
horizon
Now
here
the
rest
of
us
were
too
But
all
that
was
only
part
of
the
reason
I
had
sought
out
Lanier
I
told
him
What
I
really
hoped
to
do
I
said
was
to
talk
about
the
future
and
how
to
live
in
it
This
year
feels
like
a
crossroads
I
do
not
need
to
explain
what
I
mean
by
this
We
are
on
the
precipice
of
ruin
or
revolution
or
both
We
are
sick
of
looking
at
social
media
but
social
media
is
also
maybe
driving
the
most
significant
and
necessary
social
movement
of
my
entire
life
I
want
to
destroy
my
computer
through
which
I
now
work
and
have
drinks
and
stare
at
blurry
simulations
of
my
parents
sometimes
I
want
to
kneel
down
and
pray
to
it
like
a
god
I
want
someone—I
want
Jaron
Lanier—to
tell
me
where
we
re
going
and
whether
it
s
going
to
be
okay
when
we
get
there
Lanier
just
nodded
All
right
then
There
are
a
lot
of
jerks
on
Twitter
I
like
this
article
because
it
doesn
t
just
look
at
the
damaging
effects
of
internet
pile-ons
propelled
by
tweet
after
tweet
it
looks
specifically
at
the
effects
of
what
Cross
calls
the
third
order
of
harassment
i.
e.
the
Discourse
You
know
the
Discourse
Usually
a
subtweet
about
a
new
argument
of
the
day
A
commentary
if
you
will
You
have
a
Twitter
account
A
thing
has
happened
You
comment
on
it
to
signal
which
side
of
the
Discourse
divide
you
re
on
It
s
not
a
pile-on
it
s
just
a
statement
about
the
situation
But
that
subtweet
which
usually
doesn
t
directly
involve
the
target
of
the
Discourse
and
which
may
even
be
supportive
of
the
target
only
allows
the
harassment
to
continue
and
grow
Commentary
provides
longevity
and
longevity
extends
the
harmful
episode
regardless
of
what
is
being
said
Twitter
s
design
allows
users
to
dissociate
from
the
very
real
human
harm
they
are
inevitably
causing
just
by
being
active
on
the
platform
The
attacks
directed
at
an
individual
are
a
metacommunicative
shorthand—
I
hate
Neon
Yang
isn
t
about
Yang
it
s
about
a
suite
of
ideas
that
they
discursively
represent
you
can
t
@
an
idea
on
Twitter
only
a
person…
This
is
why
even
the
numerous
attempts
at
constructive
callouts
or
criticism
in
the
helicopter
story
saga
directed
at
both
the
original
story
and
Neon
Yang
in
later
months
merely
added
to
the
pain
and
fury
The
sheer
weight
and
volume
of
so
many
people
bearing
down
on
an
individual
all
at
once
becomes
powerfully
destructive
even
if
many
of
those
people
are
being
nice
In
order
to
write
well
or
to
create
any
kind
of
art
that
cuts
through
the
persistent
noise
of
human
experience
you
have
to
first
participate
in
that
experience
There
has
to
be
diversity
in
the
aesthetic
around
you
But
the
pandemic
year
left
us
looking
for
an
aesthetic
in
an
increasingly
isolated
and
online
world
I
scroll
through
Instagram
despite
the
fact
that
all
the
photos
are
increasingly
similar
The
algorithm
has
zeroed
in
on
the
aesthetic
it
thinks
I
like
and
serves
me
photo
after
photo
of
the
same
thing
to
keep
my
eyes
glued
my
time
monetized
for
someone
else
By
this
point
I
can
t
even
tell
the
difference
between
what
I
like
and
what
I
m
being
fed
Of
all
the
things
I
can
t
stand
about
an
Extremely
Online
life
the
theft
of
a
diverse
and
surprising
aesthetic
burns
me
the
most
Other
than
our
lives
becoming
simple
data
points
for
someone
else
s
commodification
No
matter
where
I
go
everything
looks
the
same
This
is
why
I
love
this
article
about
the
increasing
frictionlessness
of
the
various
aesthetics
popularized
at
large
open
concept
kitchens
industrial
design
Edison
bulbs
over
every
table
and
how
the
curation
of
a
single
aesthetic
specifically
by
AirBnb
has
made
it
possible
to
travel
from
city
to
city
even
internationally
without
noticing
a
difference
We
could
call
this
strange
geography
created
by
technology
AirSpace
It
s
the
realm
of
coffee
shops
bars
startup
offices
and
co-live
/
work
spaces
that
share
the
same
hallmarks
everywhere
you
go
a
profusion
of
symbols
of
comfort
and
quality
at
least
to
a
certain
connoisseurial
mindset
Minimalist
furniture
Craft
beer
and
avocado
toast
Reclaimed
wood
Industrial
lighting
Cortados
Fast
internet
The
homogeneity
of
these
spaces
means
that
traveling
between
them
is
frictionless
a
value
that
Silicon
Valley
prizes
and
cultural
influencers
like
Schwarzmann
take
advantage
of
Changing
places
can
be
as
painless
as
reloading
a
website
You
might
not
even
realize
you
re
not
where
you
started
To
me
social
media
increasingly
feels
like
a
cult
It
doesn
t
matter
which
platform
I
m
on
people
exhibit
the
same
linear
thought
necessary
for
cult
indoctrination
regardless
of
topic
It
doesn
t
matter
what
I
think
about
a
topic
the
Discourse
has
already
been
decided
for
me
for
all
of
us
Now
virality
not
facts
equals
truth
Questioning
out
loud
has
become
increasingly
difficult
As
Nguyen
notes
in
this
essay
two
things
are
needed
for
cult
thinking
to
bloom
epistemic
bubbles
combined
with
echo
chambers
and
social
media
has
it
in
spades
So
yeah
we
re
in
a
cult
Time
to
call
our
dads
In
epistemic
bubbles
other
voices
are
not
heard
in
echo
chambers
other
voices
are
actively
undermined
The
way
to
break
an
echo
chamber
is
not
to
wave
the
facts
in
the
faces
of
its
members
It
is
to
attack
the
echo
chamber
at
its
root
and
repair
that
broken
trust

Once
upon
a
time
James
Doxey
lived
with
his
wife
in
an
inherited
home
that
had
served
their
family
for
generations
When
Hurricane
Audrey
flooded
homes
from
their
foundations
in
1957
survivors
swam
to
its
porch
The
storm
surge
had
moved
20
miles
inland
overnight
catching
them
in
their
sleep
More
than
500
people
died
Their
home
survived
every
subsequent
storm
that
hit
Southwest
Louisiana
until
Hurricane
Laura
came
through
in
summer
2020
What
remains
is
a
stout
set
of
concrete
stairs
They
lead
to
a
slab
Once
upon
a
time
they
framed
his
front
door
Down
the
road
I
meet
Angela
her
sister-in-law
Victoria
and
her
father
Carl
James
in
the
camper
trailer
they
bought
after
losing
their
first
home
When
hurricanes
come
they
drive
it
off
the
lot
These
are
some
of
the
people
still
left
in
Cameron
Parish
There
is
nowhere
else
they
would
ever
go
Cameron
Parish
is
Louisiana
s
largest
by
landmass
once
made
up
of
thousands
of
miles
of
grass
marshland
and
water
So
much
of
this
wilderness
has
already
washed
into
the
Gulf
Louisiana
s
coast
is
among
the
most
rapidly
disappearing
places
on
earth
What
is
lost
amounts
roughly
to
the
size
of
the
state
of
Delaware
what
is
left
continues
to
go

I
know
since
1969
I
own
some
property
out
here
on
Hackberry
Beach
From
1969
we
have
lost
1,800
feet
of
land
If
you
ve
never
been
out
there
let
me
draw
you
a
map
You
go
south
from
Lake
Charles
the
closest
city
inland
over
Conway
LeBleu
the
most
beautiful
bridge
in
the
world
this
tall
elegant
winnowy
thing
where
you
look
out
over
all
of
the
marsh
covering
the
last
stretch
of
Louisiana
s
Gulf
Coast
You
ride
down
a
two-lane
highway
with
water
rising
up
on
either
side
of
the
car
You
re
almost
scared
to
go
out
there
scared
you
ll
run
right
off
the
side
of
the
road
I
hit
a
snake
crossing
in
front
of
me
saw
pink
herons
spring
up
above
my
windshield
pumped
gas
in
floodwater
up
to
my
calves
when
it
came
in
during
high
tide
I
got
lost
had
to
turn
around
and
feared
for
my
life
Folks
out
there
drive
trucks
for
good
reason
when
the
tide
comes
in
it
floods
over
the
main
road
Despite
its
size
Cameron
is
now
one
of
Louisiana
s
most
sparsely
inhabited
parishes
due
to
its
proximity
to
our
eroding
coast
and
vulnerability
to
hurricanes
The
population
splintered
after
Audrey
1957
then
Rita
2005
then
Ike
2008
and
then
Laura
2020
and
Delta
2020
Before
Rita
several
thousand
people
lived
out
there
after
Laura
and
Delta
Angela
Trahan
Doxey
A
lot
of
people
left
For
good
Carl
James
Trahan
Yeah
there
s
probably
less
than
50
%
come
back
How
many
people
live
here
right
now
Carl

Here
On
this
ridge
Yeah
that

what
I

the

to

reconstruction
took
over
a
month
though
they
are
still
running
substations

out
in
Cameron
Parish
When
Hurricane
Delta
October
2020
followed
a
little
over
a
month
later
there
was
no
fixing
them
up
It
was
May
2021
when
I
went
and
the
houses
left
were
totally
done
for
as
if
they
had
been
mauled
and
left
for
dead
I
passed
contents
strewn
in
both
directions
for
miles
driving
in
Tarps
hung
tattered
from
their
roofs
blue
flags
of
surrender
The

were
torn
off

you
could

through

They
sat
tall

ruined
haunted

This
is
the
third
time
I
ve
started
over
in
my
life
Angela
Trahan
Doxey
I
did
it
as
a
kid
as
a
parent
Carl
James
Trahan
Rita
Ike
and
Laura
the
third
time
I
ve
lost
everything
It
s
expensive
[
laughs
]
After
a
certain
point
you
stop
buying
stuff
Carl
James
Trahan
Well
that
s
why
we
ended
up
in
campers
now
Angela
Trahan
Doxey
It
s
more
permanent
You
get
attached
to
less
You
start
buying
less
after
the
first
hurricane
or
second
hurricane
you
learn
what
you
need
that
s
more
important
to
pack
up
and
what
matters
more
Why
did
I
go
I
grew
up
in
Lake
Charles
not
far
about
the
closest
city
inland
from
the
coast
It
is
a
small
town
sweet
and
southern
and
kind
of
like
Mayberry
where
everybody
knows
everybody
and
spends
their
whole
life
driving
up
and
down
the
same
two
roads
It
was
a
charming
if
not
a
superficially
unremarkable
place
to
grow
up
in
like
many
other
close-knit
communities
littered
across
the
South
We
have
coffee
at
the
diner
We
have
dinner
in
front
of
the
television
most
weeknights
But
everything
has
changed
It
is
America
s
most
weather-battered
city
after
the
litany
of
natural
disasters
that
struck
it
in
the
past
year-and-a-half
two
hurricanes
an
ice
storm
a
thousand-year
flood
and
then
tornadoes
In
2020
the
New
York
Times
identified
it
as
the
city
with
the
highest
number
of
displaced
residents
in
America
You
drive
up
and
down
those
streets
and
it
s
as
if
time
has
stopped
despite
whatever
progress
that
recovery
efforts
have
made
it
still
looks
bombed
In
May
2021
my
mom
lost
about
everything
inside
the
house
I
grew
up
in
during
that
flood
we
walked
furniture
photographs
and
15
years
of
moldy
ballet
costumes
out
to
the
side
of
the
road
From
our
kitchen
window
I
watched
people
take
what
they
could
salvage
from
our
trash
wooden
furniture
that
sat
in
sewage
for
five
hours
until
the
water
receded
old
clothes
that
stank
of
mildew
and
fetid
rot
Why
did
I
go
I
know
that
when
storms
hit
us
they
hit
Cameron
first
I
know
we
spent
over
a
year
after
Hurricanes
Laura
and
Delta
without
federal
aid
waiting
in
hope
and
agony
with
bated
breath
I
know
that
when
that
aid
did
arrive
it
failed
us
$
600
million
dollars
to
address
$
3
billion
in
unmet
housing
needs
damaged
schools
and
businesses
debris
removal
and
infrastructure
I
know
that
$
2
7
billion
was
allocated
toward
Hurricane
Ida
recovery
in
New
Orleans
down
the
road
only
after
a
month
or
so
I
assume
that
what
little
we
get
in
Lake
Charles
those
out
in
Cameron
get
even
less
So
when
you
consider
the
devastation
we
were
subjected
to
and
how
it
compounded
after
more
than
a
year
of
no
aid
just
federal
neglect
they
got
next
to
nothing
at
all
I
wanted
to
understand
what
failures
of
government
mutual
aid
and
human
decency
led
us
here
well
over
a
year
later
with
a
region
still
totally
undone
I
wanted
to
understand
the
reasons
the
people
in
charge
failed
us
how
they
could
live
with
themselves
in
spite
of
it
and
why
so
few
people
outside
the
region
heard
what
happened
here
or
gave
a
shit
if
they
did
It
is
true
it
is
a
news
desert
the
closest
rag
inland
is
the
American
Press
in
Lake
Charles
which
functions
as
a
community
bulletin
board
Facebook
is
how
people
communicate
with
each
other
But
this
community
is
small
insular
and
not
particularly
well-off
our
friend
lists
mostly
read
of
one
another
If
you
weren
t
around
last
year
it
is
not
some
destination
it
is
unlikely
you
d
ever
know
what
was
going
on
But
people
in
positions
of
power
and
influence
did
visit
Donald
Trump
took
photos
in
front
of
my
friend
Jack
s
house
while
he
was
still
president
and
passed
out
autographed
portraits
of
himself
which
he
invited
city
officials
to
sell
on
eBay
to
help
with
the
cost
of
recovery
and
repairs
Joe
Biden
didn
t
do
much
better
He
promised
aid
then
raised
flood
insurance
premiums
for
at
least
five
million
homeowners
in
predominantly
working
class
coastal
communities
instead
I
get
it
It
s
not
a
politically
advantageous
cause
But
this
is
not
a
partisan
issue
It
is
a
crisis
of
conscience
It
is
a
constitutional
obligation
and
even
then
so
many
are
excluded
from
aid
arbitrarily
the
indigenous
immigrants
those
incarcerated
those
without
homes
These
are
Americans
who
have
been
left
to
fend
for
themselves
on
the
forefront
of
climate
change
They
lost
the
better
part
of
everything
they
worked
their
whole
lives
to
own
They
pay
their
taxes
They
fought
in
all
of
America
s
stupid
wars
If
you
don
t
quite
see
it
yet
I
will
tell
you
Out
in
Cameron
it
is
just
between
you
and
God
There
is
no
other
witness
It
is
just
you
and
the
water
and
the
earth
and
something
mystic
up
in
the
sky
watching
over
The
rare
neighbor
is
20
or
so
miles
down
the
road
Mr
Doxey
and
I
get
around
to
talking
about
what
happens
if
you
re
unlucky
enough
to
have
a
heart
attack
there
is
no
hospital
He
laughs
at
me
no
hesitation
You
die
Just
how
bad
did
it
get
I
imagine
you
wonder
It
was
hell
It
still
is
There
are
at
least
100
caskets
with
corpses
rotting
inside
them
in
trailers
out
in
Cameron
Parish
and
probably
20
body
bags
They
came
up
after
Hurricane
Laura
when
the
17-foot
storm
surge
in
Creole
flooded
them
away
Reburials
are
delayed
while
the
state
has
yet
to
distribute
money
necessary
to
fix
the
cemeteries
and
reinter
them
in
new
graves
I
talked
to
Patrick
Hebert
a
marsh
contractor
who
specializes
in
levee
and
terrace
construction
debris
clearing
excavation
dozer
work
and
oil
spill
cleanup
He
handled
the
retrieval
himself
along
with
his
small
crew
hunting
down
remains
in
Cameron
s
bogs
and
marsh
Patrick
Hebert
Right
after
the
storm
we
started
picking
them
up
and
bringing
them
to
my
shop
And
that
s
in
Sweet
Lake
right
Patrick
Hebert
Yes
And
then
we
just
stored
em
and
I
didn
t
know
what
else
to
do
ya
know
Right
what
a
hard
job
Patrick
Hebert
Yeah
it
s
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
I
ll
tell
you
that
Are
they
all
in
caskets
or
are
you
finding
…
Patrick
Hebert
So
like
90
%
of
the
time
it
s
kind
of
a
boring
deal
you
can
pull
right
up
with
an
air
boat
and
two
guys
can
usually
get
the
casket
on
the
boat
It
s
very
uneventful
But
about
10
%
of
the
time
you
re
gon
na
have
some
issue
like
maybe
the
casket
is
underwater
or
full
of
water
and
mud
and
then
we
can
t
physically
…
like
the
casket
will
just
break
apart
if
you
try
to
pick
it
up
And
it
s
too
heavy
for
men
to
pick
up
So
then
we
have
to
cut
em
open
and
put
the
body
in
a
body
bag
or
whatever
we
can
find
in
there
I
had
about
75
caskets
stacked
up
in
the
back
of
my
shop
just
covered
up
for
tarps
for
quite
a
while
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
long
they
were
left
there
Patrick
Hebert
You
know
it
was
probably
60
or
90
days
before
we
saw
somebody
from
the
Attorney
General
s
office
actually
come
to
my
shop
And
so
at
that
point
they
went
and
moved
them
to
Creole
correct
Patrick
Hebert
Right
We
loaded
them
in
some
18-wheeler
van
trailers
and
they
pulled
…
well
I
actually
pulled
em
I
brought
em
all
to
Creole
and
they
just
sat
there
and
nothin
s
happened
since
ya
know
They
re
renting
the
trailers
to
leave
the
bodies
in
but
they
haven
t
moved
forward
with
doing
anything
yet
You
know
At
least
have
them
more
identified
because
they
still
have
the
identification
tags
on
the
caskets
and
we
recorded
it
as
we
picked
them
up
And
I
know
at
least
half
of
em
Right
that
s
how
Cameron
is
everybody
is
family
more
or
less
Patrick
Hebert
Oh
yeah
yeah
That
s
kinda
why
we
did
it
with
Rita
because
shit
half
of
em
that
I
was
picking
up
I
knew
who
they
were
or
I
at
least
knew
their
kids
Ya
know
I
m
a
wetland
general
contractor
We
really
do
all
of
our
work
in
the
marsh
I
got
marsh
buggies
and
air
boats
So
we
re
out
there
all
the
time
I
mean
you
re
on
a
job
and
you
run
across
a
casket
sittin
somewhere
you
can
t
not
pick
it
up
You
know
Of
course
not
Patrick
Hebert
I
mean
shit
You
must
feel
traumatized
at
times
Patrick
Hebert
I
mean
I
m
gon
na
be
honest
with
ya
I
m
just
not
that
kinda
guy
It
doesn
t
bother
me
as
much
as
it
bothers
other
people
apparently
ya
know
The
first
time
I
went
and
did
that
in
05
it
s
kind
of
a
funny
story
but
one
of
my
airboat
drivers
grew
up
in
the
funeral
home
business
and
he
was
actually
a
licensed
mortician
okay
So
he
was
good
with
all
that
It
didn
t
bother
him
one
bit
And
he
and
I
were
the
first
ones
to
start
pickin
em
up
And
he
was
so
nonchalant
about
it
that
it
kind
of
rubbed
off
on
me
like
well
you
know
I
guess
it
s
not
that
big
a
deal
it
s
just
a
body
and
we
ll
get
it
done
I
don
t
have
nightmares
about
it
or
anything
like
that…
although
I
m
sure
lots
of
people
would
if
they
saw
some
of
the
stuff
I
saw
Do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
ve
seen
Patrick
Hebert
Well
like
I
said
90
%
of
the
time
we
don
t
even
open
the
casket
But
about
10
%
of
the
time
there
s
gon
na
be
some
issue
They
re
gon
na
be
full
of
water
or
perhaps
it
s
a
family
that
s
been
callin
about
one
and
I
ve
got
a
description
on
a
casket
so
we
ll
open
the
casket
to
make
sure
what
clothes
they
had
on
so
we
could
help
identify
em
I
ask
a
mortician
what
dead
bodies
look
like
She
tells
me
after
a
certain
point
they
turn
pitch
black
it
takes
a
while
to
get
down
to
just
bones
I
call
Ryan
Seidmann
who
runs
the
state
s
Cemetery
Response
Task
Force
through
the
Attorney
General
s
Office
to
confirm
that
what
Patrick
said
was
true
I
m
curious
about
the
situation
with
the
caskets
that
are
being
held
in
Cameron
Parish
in
the
trailers
Why
are
they
being
held
in
these
trailers
instead
of
reburied
Ryan
Seidmann
Because
…
well
there
are
roughly
two
answers
to
that
Number
one
not
all
of
them
are
able
to
be
identified
based
upon
what
is
on
the
exterior
of
the
caskets
So
only
about
half
of
them
are
known
individuals
And
then
for
those
we
are
still
waiting
in
many
cases
on
FEMA
funding
to
repair
the
graves
that
they
came
out
of
before
they
can
go
back
So
those
are
just
kind
of
in
a
holding
pattern
for
their
graves
to
be
repaired
which
are
in
turn
in
a
holding
pattern
from
FEMA
for
the
funding
The
ineptitude
continues
Danny
Lavergne
the
director
of
Cameron
s
Office
of
Emergency
Preparedness
tells
me
it
took
51
weeks
for
FEMA
to
get
201
people
housed
in
mobile
housing
units
after
Hurricane
Laura
For
months
they
refused
to
place
camper
trailers
in
a
flood
zone
before
abruptly
reversing
that
decision
without
reason
or
explanation
That
s
how
arbitrary
bureaucracy
can
be
But
it
fucks
up
your
life
For
nine
months
201
people
were
homeless
and
waiting
They
made
do
in
loved
ones
living
rooms
in
their
cars
in
hotel
rooms
they
had
to
drive
in
from
situated
far
and
wide
across
the
state
People
lived
this
way
through
the
fall
and
into
spring
throughout
the
pandemic
in
2020
when
at
times
Louisiana
suffered
among
the
highest
caseloads
in
the
United
States
long
before
there
were
any
vaccines
Cameron
s
only
hospital
is
still
operating
out
of
a
tent
with
limited
services
Lake
Charles
has
no
homeless
shelter
and
all
the
hotels
and
apartments
in
close
vicinity
were
damaged
or
price
gouged
to
match
the
demand
for
livable
housing
In
the
meantime
while
they
waited
on
FEMA
to
coordinate
temporary
housing
do
tell
me
where
exactly
were
these
people
supposed
to
go
I
asked
Angela
and
Carl
what
they
got
in
FEMA
assistance
only
$
500
for
immediate
recovery
expenses
They
were
denied
for
housing
assistance
lodging
reimbursement
and
the
cost
of
their
generator
Meanwhile
I
know
people
in
New
Orleans
that
had
no
damage
from
Hurricane
Ida
and
got
$
1,500
fast
while
most
everyone
in
Cameron
lost
everything
that
they
owned
There
is
no
equity
in
the
economics
FEMA
uses
to
justify
their
system
of
aid
In
Cameron
Parish
folks
make
their
living
selling
bait
for
fish
in
what
must
be
one
of
the
most
polluted
bodies
of
water
on
earth
y
all
saw
that
video
of
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
on
fire
after
a
gas
leak
a
few
months
ago
It
is
also
significantly
more
difficult
to
access
material
goods
in
rural
places
when
resources
are
scarce
after
disasters
and
everything
costs
more
to
import
in
the
first
place
If
you
choose
not
to
buy
something
that
costs
a
lot
at
the
one
store
that
has
goods
in
stock
where
else
are
you
gon
na
go
I
remember
after
Rita
my
mom
told
me
they
gave
her
$
1,500
after
the
storm
Angela
Trahan
Doxey
Sure
And
then
after
this
storm
she
applied
and
they
only
gave
her
$
500
I
m
wondering
if
people
around
here
got
any
money
after
the
storm
[
Laughter
]
No
Victoria
Trahan
All
we
got
was
the
$
500
and
we
got
denied
for
everything
else
Carl
tells
me
he
believes
Hurricane
Laura
s
wind
speeds
were
a
lot
higher
than
the
153
mph
logged
in
official
reports
He
claims
that
on
the
crane
out
in
Cameron
they
registered
202
mph
and
198
mph
at
the
Port
of
Lake
Charles
I
looked
into
it
but
couldn
t
find
the
numbers
he
mentioned
But
I
did
speak
with
Roger
Erickson
a
meteorologist
working
with
the
National
Weather
Service
in
Lake
Charles
who
led
me
to
believe
what
Carl
said
just
might
be
true
Do
you
know
at
what
point
the
weather
instruments
that
were
measuring
everything
went
offline
Roger
Erickson
I
wan
na
say
the
radar
and
the
observations
both
went
out
about
the
same
time
It
was
around
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
So
it
was
before
the
storm
hit
Roger
Erickson
Right
Well
I
mean
the
eye
was
still
moving
on
shore
but
the
eye
wasn
t
up
over
us
yet
for
another
hour
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
strongest
wind
was
Roger
Erickson
Yeah
Well
in
terms
of
actual
numbers
that
we
got
there
s
133
134
135
numbers
Why
do
you
use
air
quotations
when
you
say
that
Roger
Erickson
Because
it
was
higher
than
that
But
that
s
the
How
much
higher
Roger
Erickson
In
my
opinion
it
s
probably
gon
na
be
in
the
140
to
150
range
from
the
gusts
From
the
gusts
You
don
t
think
it
got
any
higher
Roger
Erickson
Well
yeah
it
coulda
been
higher
When
we
go
out
and
do
tornado
surveys
I
see
damage
to
whatever
there
s
an
app
that
I
use
to
determine
how
strong
the
winds
were
to
cause
the
damage
that
I
m
looking
at
So
using
that
after
a
hurricane
you
can
do
the
same
thing
Everything
that
I
had
was
in
the
140
to
150
range
And
that
was
about
an
hour
before
the
eye
got
to
shore
Roger
Erickson
About
Yeah
But
the
reality
is
it
could
have
been
20
or
30
miles
an
hour
more
because
if
I
know
that
the
minimum
requirement
to
damage
this
thing
is
140
I
know
that
it
s
at
least
140
but
heck
it
could
ve
been
200
for
all
I
know
But
you
can
t
prove
it
All
I
know
is
it
s
for
sure
140
You
know
what
I
m
saying
You
re
stuck
with
whatever
the
lowest
threshold
to
cause
that
damage
that
you
re
looking
at
So
that
s
the
problem
with
after
a
tornado
or
after
a
hurricane
you
look
at
the
damage
you
go
okay
well
that
s
140-mile-an-hour
that
s
120-mile-an-hour
But
in
reality
it
could
ve
been
180
coming
through
here
but
you
don
t
know
that
because
there
wasn
t
anything
strong
enough
to
hold
up
180
that
would
ve
shown
it
One-hundred
and
eighty
an
hour
the
disaster
passes
and
then
begins
the
war
Despite
changes
to
the
state
s
legal
policy
in
2005
after
Hurricane
Katrina
insurance
companies
largely
failed
to
pay
policyholders
their
premiums
within
the
mandatory
30-day
timeframe
after
Hurricanes
Laura
and
Delta
It
took
my
mother
over
a
year
to
get
what
she
needed
to
fix
our
home
Roger
Erickson
I
haven
t
heard
of
anyone
really
having
a
good
story
And
after
[
Hurricane
]
Rita
I
mean
most
of
us
had
an
okay
process
getting
our
money
from
our
insurance
company
I
heard
wonderful
stories
Roger
Erickson
The
only
people
that
had
a
problem
in
Rita
were
the
people
closer
to
the
coast
because
the
insurance
companies
were
arguing
whether
the
damage
to
their
houses
was
from
the
water
or
the
wind
Because
they
re
like
if
it
s
from
the
water
we
re
not
gon
na
pay
you
that
So
I
mean
we
had
proof
from
that
Cameron
gauge
that
no
the
wind
happened
first
and
then
the
water
rose
So
we
were
able
to
help
the
residents
down
there
What
came
first
the
wind
or
the
water
It
s
an
ambiguous
genesis
the
facts
of
which
nobody
will
ever
know
But
it
matters
homeowners
insurance
and
flood
insurance
are
each
separate
policies
at
any
given
time
you
are
only
eligible
to
file
a
claim
with
one
or
the
other
not
both
If
your
homeowners
insurance
determines
that
the
damage
sustained
was
first
caused
by
a
flood
they
have
no
obligation
to
you
The
compensation
you
are
entitled
to
also
differs
depending
on
the
policy
that
applies
Homeowners
insurance
pays
the
costs
necessary
to
repair
your
house
and
temporarily
relocate
you
but
FEMA
s
flood
insurance
policy
does
not
It
is
only
intended
to
reimburse
you
for
the
loss
of
your
contents
and
the
home
s
damages
When
it
comes
to
finding
someplace
to
live
if
your
house
is
left
uninhabitable
you
are
more
or
less
on
your
own
Angela
Trahan
Well
see
FEMA
right
here
we
ain
t
get
no
money
from
em
They
denied
me
because
they
said
I
was
supposed
to
carry
flood
insurance
It
s
a
camper
You
can
t
carry
flood
insurance
on
a
camper
So
it
didn
t
matter
that
I
was
supposed
to
carry
flood
insurance
from
receiving
assistance
in
a
previous
hurricane
And
they
denied
me
because
of
flood
It
was
a
natural
disaster
It
was
tidal
water
driven
by
hurricane
force
winds
And
then
I
said
talk
to
the
weatherman
I
m
not
a
weatherman
But
before
the
tidal
wave
got
here
before
the
water
even
got
here
there
is
no
way
mine
was
sitting
here
through
the
winds
When
the
government
doesn
t
pay
attention
people
run
around
undeterred
with
their
scams
I
discovered
one
by
accident
while
interviewing
Rob
Gaudet
who
runs
the
Cajun
Relief
Foundation
nonprofit
He
listed
at
least
four
different
groups
that
collect
their
own
money
separately
from
one
another
under
variations
of
the
Cajun
Navy
name
like
gangs
at
war
with
one
another
They
each
have
their
sovereign
territory
when
they
cross
into
one
another
s
one
runs
the
other
right
back
off
He
bragged
to
me
that
he
raised
a
million
dollars
to
provide
aid
and
essential
resources
after
Hurricanes
Laura
and
Delta
the
ice
storm
and
the
flood
I
was
genuinely
impressed
by
this
I
drove
out
there
to
do
more
or
less
the
same
thing
pass
out
food
and
water
and
supplies
to
everybody
and
could
only
gather
a
little
over
$
1,000
The
need
was
so
great
we
had
to
turn
people
away
It
s
the
power
of
social
media
he
tells
me
People
love
their
brand
And
yes
they
know
that
name
It
is
a
funny
inside
joke
The
Cajun
Navy
is
a
colloquialism
that
describes
our
neighbors
who
rescue
one
another
in
boats
I
noticed
something
strange
start
to
happen
When
I
called
him
for
help
his
group
never
showed
up
He
claims
they
did
do
work
out
there
they
passed
out
thousands
of
meals
helped
with
muck
and
gut
tarped
roofs
and
hauled
debris
which
is
what
neighbors
do
for
one
another
He
s
posted
videos
all
year
on
Facebook
I
guess
to
prove
it
to
himself
to
everybody
else
and
now
I
assume
to
me
But
I
had
doubts
He
let
it
slip
that
he
spent
$
200,000
of
that
one
million
dollars
on
real
estate
and
between
$
60,000
and
$
70,000
fixing
up
the
house
he
bought
so
that
it
s
something
that
he
can
eventually
flip
The
home
was
substantially
damaged
he
said
its
previous
owners
just
wanted
out
of
it
His
volunteers
lived
in
it
as
they
disaster-tourismed
their
way
in
and
out
of
town
while
collecting
a
stipend
Meanwhile
the
demand
for
livable
housing
after
Hurricanes
Laura
and
Delta
was
so
great
during
Christmas
of
2020
that
a
small
tent
community
was
set
up
by
the
lake
Of
that
one
million
dollars
he
donated
$
10,000
to
a
different
mutual
aid
group
organizing
housing
relief
five
months
after
the
first
storm
hit
Gaudet
then
proceeds
to
sell
me
an
elevator
pitch
of
the
disaster
relief
startup
he
wants
to
turn
his
nonprofit
into
so
he
can
eventually
sell
it
to
the
feds
I
looked
up
his
IRS
records
with
his
EIN
It
turns
out
he
failed
to
file
the
last
few
years
and
in
2020
when
the
IRS
revoked
his
tax-exempt
status
he
filed
for
2016
four
years
late
So
they
reinstated
it
I
have
the
property
records
for
the
home
In
an
attempt
I
assume
to
intimidate
me
he
mentions
his
friendship
with
Jeff
Landry
Louisiana
s
Attorney
General
he
says
he
calls
him
anytime
anyone
tries
to
accuse
him
of
doing
something
wrong
He
mentions
his
paranoia
that
at
one
point
he
started
to
carry
a
gun
I
recorded
him
What
have
y
all
been
doing
with
donations
that
you
have
received
Rob
Gaudet
Donations
are
going
to
…
we
do
pay
some
of
our
volunteers
They
become
team
members
to
stay
Marissa
has
been
there
since
December
she
has
her
own
life
Robin
was
there
for
three
months
They
re
away
they
re
coming
back
So
we
pay
our
team
members
I
bought
a
house
for
these
guys
to
live
in
We
bought
some
equipment
like
a
skid-steer
We
bought
a
trailer
for
the
skid-steer
We
bought
a
tool
trailer
for
all
the
tools
we
have
We
bought
tools
So
we
re
building
up
our
infrastructure
with
the
donations
that
we
have
And
then
we
put
people
in
hotel
rooms
I
gave
$
10,000
to
Dominique
and
Roischetta
during
the
ice
storm
for
the
people
in
the
hotels
For
the
Vessel
Project
Yeah
Rob
Gaudet
Yeah
We
bought
heaters
We
bought
blankets
We
buy
stuff
for
people
and
we
give
it
to
them
We
don
t
really
donate
money
directly
to
people
usually
We
will
provide
supplies
to
them
pick
them
up
and
move
them
around
We
re
just
using
it
to
cover
our
expenses
while
we
re
in
town
Gotcha
Rob
Gaudet
And
I
will
tell
you
I
raised
a
million
dollars
Wow
And
that
is
specifically
targeted
towards
Laura
relief
Rob
Gaudet
Towards
Laura
but
some
of
it
was
for
the
ice
storm
But
mostly
Laura
and
Delta
[
Was
the
house
you
purchased
]
damaged
or
was
it
in
okay
shape
Rob
Gaudet
It
was
damaged
it
was
damaged
The
back
side
of
the
roof
was
lifted
off
So
did
y
all
repair
that
home
Rob
Gaudet
Yes
It
s
not
fully
repaired
It
didn
t
flood
Lake
Street
in
front
of
our
house
flooded
pretty
badly
but
it
didn
t
flood
And
how
much
did
you
buy
it
for
Rob
Gaudet
$
200,000
The
individuals
wanted
out
of
it
And
the
roof
was
really
badly
damaged
so
we
had
to
have
the
roof
repaired
put
in
new
rafters
decking
re-roof
the
whole
thing
re-shingle
it
and
then
do
the
inside
repairs
We
re
pretty
close
to
being
done
It
s
not
quite
done
yet
though
After
you
re
finished
with
repairs
what
is
your
plan
for
the
house
Rob
Gaudet
We
re
gon
na
sell
it
Yeah
we
re
gon
na
sell
it
We
re
pretty
close
to
getting
it
on
the
market
actually
How
much
will
you
sell
it
for
Rob
Gaudet
I
think
we
re
going
to
ask
$
340,000
We
ve
put
some
money
into
it
We
ve
probably
put
$
60,000
or
$
70,000
in
repairs
into
it
Obviously
you
want
to
get
as
much
for
a
house
as
you
can
And
that
money
goes
back
…
it
s
bought
in
the
Cajun
Navy
nonprofit
name
and
it
all
goes
back
to
the
nonprofit
At
the
start
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
the
Trump
administration
suspended
pollution
monitoring
and
reporting
mandates
that
companies
were
previously
obligated
to
disclose
to
the
agency
As
a
result
we
won
t
ever
know
the
immediate
environmental
impact
of
Hurricane
Laura
because
this
order
expired
only
a
few
days
after
the
storm
hit
The
data
just
isn
t
there
And
there
are
so
many
parties
with
vested
interests
in
covering
up
leaks
and
spills
in
that
area
The
Lake
Charles
economy
is
deeply
dependent
upon
chemical
refineries
and
oil
rigs
in
the
Gulf
But
they
could
not
hide
the
chlorine
spill
at
BioLab
after
Hurricane
Laura
when
it
clouded
I-10
West
for
several
hours
and
forced
it
to
shut
down
Those
who
hadn
t
evacuated
were
advised
to
shelter
in
place
There
is
a
national
chlorine
shortage
as
a
direct
result
The
only
reason
industry
rebuilds
is
to
continue
to
produce
rice
plastic
bleach
and
oil
Lake
Charles
and
Cameron
are
sacrificial
land
for
these
industries
I
thought
those
towers
and
bright
lights
sparkling
in
the
distance
were
New
York
growing
up
That
s
how
many
there
are
Little
cities
pumping
poison
into
the
water
we
swallow
into
the
air
we
breathe
By
the
numbers
Southwest
Louisiana
hosts
the
majority
of
the
state
s
oil
and
gas
refineries
The
CITGO
plant
in
Lake
Charles
processes
425,000
barrels
of
crude
oil
a
day
alone
The
others
manufacture
a
medley
of
harm
plastics
the
chemical
byproducts
in
shampoos
detergents
soaps
and
bleach
It
leaches
into
our
waterways
there
is
so
much
There
is
no
place
left
to
swim
Warning
signs
are
posted
prominently
at
every
lake
and
beach
around
the
Gulf
when
people
ignore
them
they
get
staph
infections
The
tap
water
in
the
town
of
Sulphur
runs
out
the
faucet
brown
Mr
Doxey
If
it
wasn
t
for
Venture
Global
I
would
not
be
down
there
right
now
They
would
have
shut
the
lights
out
of
Cameron
That
I
can
promise
Oh
yeah
the
only
reason
they
re
rebuilding
Lake
Charles
is
because
of
the
plants
That
s
the
only
reason
they
get
any
money
Mr
Doxey
But
if
it
wasn
t
for
them
I
m
telling
you
if
this
storm
would
ve
come
two
years
before
they
started
this
plant
Oh
y
all
would
be
gone
Mr
Doxey
We
wouldn
t
even
have
electricity
This
environmental
neglect
is
not
new
or
unheard
of
take
for
example
the
Chicot
Aquifer
and
the
Condea
Vista
spill
in
the
90s
I
can
t
believe
how
well
it
s
been
covered
up
The
company
came
in
poisoned
the
region
s
main
drinking
aquifer
with
ethylene
dichloride
in
one
of
the
largest
and
longest-running
chemical
spills
in
our
nation
s
history
and
just
never
disclosed
it
to
those
of
us
who
live
there
Between
19
and
47
million
pounds
of
carcinogenic
chemicals
were
siphoned
into
Lake
Charles
and
its
surrounding
waterways
through
faulty
pipelines
I
drank
the
water
from
the
tap
growing
up
There
was
no
class
action
lawsuit
or
city-wide
settlement
They
poisoned
us
forever
and
they
never
bothered
to
finish
cleaning
it
up
So
tell
me
what
happens
when
a
hurricane
comes
and
stirs
all
that
muck
and
water
up
What
happens
next
when
the
same
town
is
hit
by
a
major
disaster
again
The
water
has
to
flood
somewhere
And
that
s
just
old
chemical
waste
polluting
our
waterways
through
to
the
ground
There
is
no
telling
what
else
spilled
in
the
Gulf
afterwards
that
they
won
t
ever
talk
about
I
ve
made
my
peace
with
the
fact
that
we
won
t
ever
know
the
chemical
cocktail
of
waste
they
burned
off
into
Lake
Charles
beforehand
Just
the
other
day
there
was
another
industry
explosion
Ethylene
dichloride
was
implicated
yet
again
Why
do
we
stay
I
can
t
give
up
on
it
It
is
the
birthplace
of
my
culture
and
my
home
We
are
the
Cajuns
some
of
the
last
few
left
first
exiled
from
Acadia
only
a
few
hundred
years
ago
in
Le
Grand
Dérangement
when
we
refused
colonization
by
the
British
This
is
what
brought
us
to
Louisiana
this
beautiful
godforsaken
wasteland
Y
all
break
my
heart
with
this
trying
to
run
us
off
once
again
So
y
all
told
me
a
little
bit
about
how
y
all
s
neighbors
are
leaving
and
y
all
s
plan
is
to
stay
no
matter
what
Angela
Trahan
Doxey
Keep
comin
back
Tell
me
how
you
make
that
decision
Angela
Trahan
Doxey
I
m
from
here
Family
land
Victoria
Trahan
My
husband
says
that
if
daddy
comes
back
he
comes
back
And
he
always
said
if
there
s
a
fence
post
on
the
property
I
m
stayin
So
that
s
what
my
husband
goes
by
And
see
this
was
my
first
time
losing
everything
When
Rita
hit
I
was
little
We
went
on
vacation
to
Tennessee
and
all
that
So
I
thought
it
was
fun
and
when
we
came
back
things
were
having
to
be

We
didn

know
no
better
Yeah
we
learned
through
it
…
you
re
in
school
But
then
this
hit
and
we
moved
our
camper
out
and
a
tornado
got
…
and
it
still
took
…
and
we
had
to
go
pick
up
everything
And
then
my
daughter
is
saying
[

Mama
there
s
my
house
The
rest
of
it
wasn

coming
back
I
said
it
wasn

But
I
moved
here
four
years
ago
and
I
made
this
a
home
my
kid
s
home
So
I
came
back
And
I
say
if
hurricane
season
hits
again
I

not
coming

I
know
I
ll

I

to

…
when
we
first
got
together
I
had
a
trailer
in
Lake

He
helped
me
move
into

It
was
gon

But
I
asked
him
Do
you
want
to
move
in
with
me
when
we
got
serious
and
he
[

You

baby
you

I

I

I

what

can
you
say
We
are
losing
all

to
the

to

to

to
the

to

to

to

I

it

this
when
I

again
I
drive
off
and
it
s
as
if
I
m
out

and
Gomorrah
I
look
back
and
cry

So
yeah
it
is
hell
and
also
it
is

I
have
never

I
love
it

To

to
descend
into
hellish
depths
of
human
suffering
I
do
not

how
else
to
put
it
I
have
told
everyone
I

care
tried
to

the
impossibility
of
manufacturing
any
grace

that

not

By
Pardeep
Toor
English
was
the
first
language
my
newborn
heard
after
his
birth
in
October
2021
probably
something
medical
the
midwife
said
or
congratulations
from
a
nearby
nurse
My
wife
and
I
were
speechless
focusing
only
on
our
son
s
blue
skin
piercing
screams
and
block
of
black
hair
that
overwhelmingly
confirmed
he
was
indeed
ours
As
first-time
parents
our
son
instantly
became
the
exclusive
lens
through
which
we
viewed
our
world
I
should
ve
gotten
new
windshield
wipers
to
make
sure
we
reached
home
safely
Next
time
I
will
take
my
elevated
bilirubin
levels
seriously
My
wife
swore
to
get
the
spot
on
her
retina
checked
again
She
couldn
t
remember
the
last
time
we
d
dusted
underneath
our
bed
We
d
prepared
nine
months
for
this
shift
but
it
still
shook
us
Our
lives
were
only
necessary
to
sustain
his
life
We
couldn
t
stay
speechless
for
long
The
nurses
eventually
checked
on
us
less
frequently
Poking
and
prodding
clinicians
dissipated
leaving
us
with
the
humming
overhead
tube
lights
and
beeping
in
the
hallway
It
was
our
turn
to
talk
to
our
son
but
what
would
we
say
English
wasn
t
the
first
language
for
either
of
us
My
wife
is
a
native
Spanish
speaker
and
I
exclusively
spoke
Punjabi
for
the
first
six
years
of
my
life
We
both
acquired
English
through
our
respective
educations
in
Colombia
and
Canada
We
promised
to
give
our
son
both
our
languages
despite
failing
to
acquire
them
from
each
other
English
is
our
essential
language
a
primary
means
of
communication
that
allows
us
to
thrive
as
a
couple
while
simultaneously
pulling
us
away
from
our
native
languages
and
cultures
Each
spoken
syllable
of
English
is
a
leap
away
from
our
rolling
Rs
in
Punjabi
and
Spanish
I
m
not
demonizing
English
rather
recognizing
the
challenge
of
its
dominance
in
our
lives
In
the
past
four
months
we
ve
obsessed
over
speaking
our
respective
languages
to
our
son
It
s
turned
into
a
game
My
wife
will
say
something
to
him
in
Spanish
I
ll
ask
what
she
said
she
tells
me
in
English
and
then
I
translate
it
into
Punjabi
and
say
it
louder
and
faster
back
to
our
son
as
if
his
comprehension
is
a
race
we
re
each
trying
to
win
It
s
partly
in
fun
but
also
stems
from
a
sincere
apprehension
We
re
trying
to
pass
down
our
languages
while
preserving
them
in
our
own
lives
Regardless
of
our
efforts
English
will
inevitably
become
the
common
language
that
my
wife
and
I
share
with
our
son
It
s
the
only
way
we
can
talk
to
him
without
isolating
each
other
In
doing
so
I
m
afraid
I
ll
continue
to
lose
my
native
Punjabi
and
our
son
will
forever
lose
something
he
could
have
had
This
struggle
isn
t
exclusive
to
our
family
The
loss
of
language
has
been
extensively
explored
in
the
following
essays
This
essay
outlines
the
suffering
Wong
endured
since
foregoing
her
native
language
as
a
child
for
the
sake
of
assimilating
into
America
Wong
does
a
phenomenal
job
of
incorporating
linguistic
research
in
her
analysis
giving
academic
weight
to
her
regrets
The
balance
of
personal
narrative
and
analysis
of
English
language
adoption
and
native
attrition
flows
through
the
essay
as
studies
confirm
Wong
s
feelings
yet
don
t
free
her
from
longing
for
her
first
language
I
wonder
what
Cantonese
words
my
brain
pushed
out
when
I
started
speaking
mostly
English
at
age
six
And
is
attrition
limited
to
words
What
else
did
I
lose
to
assimilate
During
her
pregnancy
Wong
commits
to
re-learning
her
native
Cantonese
so
she
can
pass
it
on
to
her
child
However
despite
her
efforts
she
feels
the
impossibility
of
her
task
Like
learning
how
to
spell
only
the
more
I
look
at
Jyutping
the
more
the
words
start
to
make
sense
But
part
of
me
knows
better
I
ll
never
speak
Cantonese
the
same
way
I
would
have
if
I
d
never
stopped
speaking
it
to
begin
with
Like
a
phantom
limb
the
memory
of
my
first
language
stays
with
me
even
with
it
gone
but
that
s
all
it
is
a
memory
It
occurs
to
me
that
trying
to
relearn
this
language
is
the
embodiment
of
my
bicultural
identity
The
American
in
me
is
determined
to
reclaim
the
Chinese
part
of
myself
Part
of
the
struggle
with
English
has
always
been
its
foreignness
The
language
either
forcefully
invaded
foreign
lands
or
immigrants
willingly
chose
to
move
west
Mishra
addresses
the
colonial
legacy
of
English
and
how
that
makes
her
feel
queasy
while
also
recognizing
the
language
s
modern
dominance
in
India
For
my
family
friends
relatives
and
teachers
English
was
seen
as
a
language
of
access
It
could
land
you
better
jobs
remove
limitations
and
open
up
avenues
English
speakers
were
high
achievers
often
conflated
with
the
colonizers
who
ruled
over
us
for
about
200
years
It
was
ironic
that
the
language
of
our
colonizers
was
seen
as
aspirational
something
that
could
lift
us
out
of
the
discomfort
that
our
parents
mid-level
jobs
put
us
through
In
reading
all
the
subjects
at
school
in
English
we
were
made
to
understand
that
English
was
the
language
of
possibilities
Mishra
reluctantly
accepts
the
realities
of
the
English
language
in
India
and
her
own
life
But
acceptance
can
also
be
an
acknowledgment
of
adaptation
it
s
not
one
or
the
other
English
or
Hindi
but
hybridity
that
can
hopefully
be
respectful
to
native
languages
and
English
s
injection
into
them
Rojas
Contreras
opens
this
essay
by
acknowledging
When
you
live
between
languages
the
conversion
of
meaning
is
an
arithmetic
in
loss
Thoughts
generated
in
one
language
come
out
awkwardly
in
English
or
sometimes
not
at
all
This
ultimately
leads
to
a
feeling
of
being
understood
sufficiently
rather
than
fully
This
loss
between
languages
catalyzed
Rojas
Contreras
to
write
her
debut
novel
Fruit
of
the
Drunken
Tree
in
English
even
though
she
thought
of
it
in
Spanish
She
constructed
the
sentences
in
Spanish
in
her
mind
but
then
immediately
translated
them
into
English
on
the
page
Why
didn
t
you
write
the
novel
in
Spanish
This
is
a
question
I
get
all
the
time
Language
is
one
of
the
things
you
sacrifice
when
you
migrate
I
wanted
to
be
true
to
the
toll
of
that
sacrifice
by
making
visible
what
exactly
was
being
lost
My
wife
loves
Rojas
Contreras
s
writing
She
sees
both
her
own
Spanish
and
English
in
the
syntax
It
s
how
she
sees
the
world
in
a
constant
state
of
translation
from
one
language
to
another
By
seeing
Rojas
Contreras
s
translated
language
on
the
page
my
wife
sees
her
worldview
being
expressed
as
a
reality
and
feels
understood
as
an
immigrant
in
the
United
States
Lahiri
an
internationally
renowned
fiction
writer
started
writing
from
scratch
in
Italian
to
escape
the
personal
weight
of
the
English
language
Why
am
I
fleeing
What
is
pursuing
me
Who
wants
to
restrain
me
The
most
obvious
answer
is
the
English
language
But
I
think
it
s
not
so
much
English
in
itself
as
everything
the
language
has
symbolized
for
me
For
practically
my
whole
life
English
has
represented
a
consuming
struggle
a
wrenching
conflict
a
continuous
sense
of
failure
that
is
the
source
of
almost
all
my
anxiety
It
has
represented
a
culture
that
had
to
be
mastered
interpreted
I
was
afraid
that
it
meant
a
break
between
me
and
my
parents
English
denotes
a
heavy
burdensome
aspect
of
my
past
I
m
tired
of
it
Lahiri
opted
not
to
re-engage
with
her
native
Bengali
which
she
spoke
with
an
accent
and
admitted
to
not
knowing
how
to
read
or
write
She
started
anew
with
Italian
placing
herself
in
a
linguistic
exile
far
removed
from
her
familial
past
in
Bengali
and
professional
life
in
English
Native
languages
and
the
projected
cultural
expectations
that
come
with
them
can
be
as
burdensome
as
chasing
a
distorted
and
romanticized
memory
or
history
Lahiri
s
fresh
start
in
Italian
vanquishes
the
obligation
of
chasing
ghosts
from
her
past
and
allows
her
to
forge
a
novel
identity
in
a
new
language
What
happens
when
all
languages
fail
When
you
re
unable
to
express
yourself
no
matter
how
many
languages
you
can
speak
That
s
where
the
future
comes
in
Vara
unable
to
express
grief
after
losing
her
sister
turned
to
an
algorithm
to
complete
her
thoughts
I
felt
acutely
that
there
was
something
illicit
about
what
I
was
doing
When
I
carried
my
computer
to
bed
my
husband
muttered
noises
of
disapproval
We
both
make
our
livings
as
writers
and
technological
capitalism
has
been
exerting
a
slow
suffocation
on
our
craft
A
machine
capable
of
doing
what
we
do
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
feels
like
a
threat
Yet
I
found
myself
irresistibly
attracted
to
GPT-3—to
the
way
it
offered
without
judgment
to
deliver
words
to
a
writer
who
has
found
herself
at
a
loss
for
them
What
followed
was
an
experiment
in
human-computer
interactions
Vara
feeds
words
into
Generative
Pre-Trained
Transformer
3
GPT-3
and
the
remaining
text
is
predicted
with
the
details
Vara
provides
about
her
sister
determining
how
the
narrative
ends
technology
offering
a
borderless
universal
language
with
infinite
memory
The
nine
stories
completed
by
artificial
intelligence
in
this
piece
are
something
new
void
of
human
attachment
Culture
in
an
algorithm
Is
this
how
people
will
one
day
express
themselves
and
understand
their
upbringing
Then
what
remains
of
the
cultural
nuances
embedded
in
our
native
languages
Are
one
or
two
or
three
languages
enough
for
our
son
Are
they
the
right
languages
What
if
they
all
fail
him
The
fear
of
losing
our
language
and
culture
to
algorithms
and
English
inspires
us
to
transmit
what
we
have
left
amidst
our
loss

Do
you
want
to
come
to
the
Christmas
pantomime
I
am
visiting
family
in
England
and
people
keep
earnestly
asking
me
this
question
It
is
not
an
invite
I
ever
receive
in
Canada
where
I
now
live
and
upon
questioning
my
American
colleagues
I
discover
none
of
them
are
trotting
off
to
see
a
pantomime
this
year
either
It
s
a
uniquely
British
festive
tradition
Jane
Moody
Professor
of
Humanities
Research
at
York
University
has
even
proclaimed
the
pantomime
quintessentially
British
as
British
as
Earl
Grey
tea
Yes
even
on
par
with
tea
It
is
hard
to
explain
a
pantomime
middle-aged
men
prancing
about
dressed
as
flamboyant
washerwomen
humans
playing
animals
princesses
dastardly
villains
and
lots
of
bawdy
jokes
Growing
up
I
would
go
and
see
a
panto
every
Christmas
so
this
is
all
normal
but
from
an
outside
perspective
I
can
see
it
could
raise
the
odd
eyebrow
In
the
words
of
Sir
Ian
McKellen
You
can
t
start
to
explain
what
a
pantomime
is
it
s
like
explaining
the
rules
of
cricket
So
I
turned
to
a
dictionary
definition
for
help
Pantomimes
are
theatrical
entertainment
mainly
for
children
involving
music
topical
jokes
and
slapstick
comedy
based
on
a
fairy
tale
or
nursery
story
The
range
of
fables
is
extensive
with
productions
at
every
town
theater
This
year
I
was
offered
Dick
Whittington
a
real
mayor
of
London
who
died
in
1423
Beauty
and
the
Beast
Aladdin
Puss
in
Boots
and
Snow
White
and
the
Seven
Dwarves
This
is
probably
where
I
should
admit
I
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
pantomimes
at
least
partially
because
they
require
a
level
of
audience
participation
that
makes
my
eyes
twitch
When
someone
on
stage
shouts
Oh
no
he
isn
t
you
are
dutifully
required
to
shout
back
Oh
yes
he
is
a
frustrating
back
and
forth
that
goes
on
for
some
time
without
satisfactory
resolution
You
are
also
encouraged
to
aid
the
hapless
hero
by
shouting
He
s
behind
you
when
a
villain
sneaks
onto
the
stage
Personally
my
annoyance
at
the
hero
s
lack
of
spatial
awareness
has
always
made
me
reluctant
to
offer
this
assistance
And
then
there
is
the
worst
part
the
constant
fear
of
being
brought
onto
the
stage
This
prospect
makes
my
nieces
and
nephews
squeal
excitedly
while
I
slide
further
down
into
my
seat
wishing
for
better
camouflage
than
red
velvet
One
year
my
niece
did
receive
this
ultimate
pantomime
honor
chosen
to
go
on
stage
to
dance
and
she
still
gleefully
talks
about
it
I
on
the
other
hand
cracked
at
my
last
panto
leaving
halfway
through
and
muttering
to
myself
about
the
dreadful
jokes
as
I
walked
home
Very
Scrooge
of
me
However
this
year
I
was
determined
to
be
jolly
and
embrace
the
Christmas
tradition
bravely
agreeing
to
a
weekend
of
back-to-back
pantomimes
with
an
evening
performance
of
Snow
White
and
the
Seven
Dwarves
and
a
matinee
of
Dick
Whittington
It
is
hard
to
explain
a
pantomime
middle-aged
men
prancing
about
dressed
as
flamboyant
washerwomen
humans
playing
animals
princesses
dastardly
villains
and
lots
of
bawdy
jokes
Ahead
of
the
performances
the
auditoriums
buzz
with
excitement
Tiny
girls
twirl
in
fairy
costumes
before
turning
to
whack
their
brothers
with
their
wands
Mothers
bounce
wide-eyed
toddlers
with
one
arm
clutching
paper
cups
full
of
wine
in
the
other
and
elderly
grandparents
adorned
with
Christmas
hats
stand
stoically
in
rings
of
lightsaber
brandishing
10-year-olds
It
is
a
reminder
that
pantomimes
are
an
event
for
the
whole
family
and
the
whole
community
with
both
shows
opening
with
a
nod
to
their
local
town
Hello
Woking
town
Snow
White
yells
from
her
castle
as
delighted
kids
scream
greetings
in
return
And
in
a
theater
one
town
over
Dick
Whittington
greets
his
audience
with
Hello
Guildford
Bet
you
re
glad
you
re
not
in
Woking
Woking
gets
off
comparatively
lightly
compared
to
Croydon
I
knew
I
d
reached
Croydon
because
I
saw
a
banner
up
saying
‘
Happy
30th
Birthday
Grandma
Nods
like
this
to
adult
humor
and
sexual
innuendo
are
a
big
part
of
the
British
panto
in
Snow
White
the
Evil
Queen
invites
two
henchmen
backstage
with
her
with
a
knowing
wink
to
the
audience
I
m
a
cougar
Meanwhile
her
jester
bemoans
about
the
size
of
his
privates
when
It
s
Cold
Outside
In
Dick
Whittington
his
love
interest
proclaims
I
m
missing
Dick
to
knowing
chuckles
from
mothers
now
grasping
their
second
wine
The
British
are
more
renowned
for
being
prim
and
proper
than
guffawing
loudly
at
the
mention
of
a
small
penis
So
how
did
these
raucous
shows
become
so
beloved
in
this
country
Jeff
Thompson
a
local
theater
critic
and
pantomime
lover
informed
me
we
can
probably
blame
the
Italians
In
the
16th
century
Italy
had
a
brand
of
entertainment
known
as
Commedia
dell
arte
comedy
of
the
artists
…a
cast
of
mischievous
characters
including
the
Harlequin
Columbine
and
Pantaloon
occasionally
masked
some
with
juggling
and
acrobatic
skills
others
as
musicians…it
was
rehearsed
chaos
of
knock-about
humor
with
the
players
appearing
in
colorful
outrageous
costumes
Different
companies
toured
the
Italian
states
and
Principalities
appearing
on
street
corners
and
market
squares
and
it
is
likely
that
they
also
came
to
London
Thompson
explains
that
an
Italian
influence
was
evident
in
London
during
the
1500s
hardly
surprising
because
London
was
a
major
trading
port
and
Shakespeare
himself…wasn
t
slow
to
exploit
this
popularity
when
choosing
Italian
locations
The
Merchant
of
Venice
Julius
Caesar
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
Romeo
and
Juliet
Titus
Andronicus
etc
By
the
1700s
the
Georgians
who
loved
to
make
things
fancy
had
adapted
the
Commedia
dell
arte
into
the
Harlequinade
According
to
Thompson
the
same
characters
were
there
Harlequin
Columbine
and
Pantaloon
but
the
Harlequinade
productions
could
now
be
seen
on
stage
with
music…the
storylines
were
classical
tales
and
familiar
fables
Progressively
domestic
stories
and
political
satire
were
also
introduced
and
the
late
1700s
and
1800s
saw
the
introduction
of
elaborate
state
scenery
and
‘
phantasmagorical
effects
which
echo
into
contemporary
productions
The
master
of
the
Harlequinade
was
a
man
named
John
Rich
who
managed
Lincoln
Fields
theater
in
the
1720s
I
was
rather
pleased
to
learn
that
Rich
introduced
the
term
slapstick
into
the
English
language
his
harlequin
used
a
wooden
bat
to
knock
things
down
but
he
would
probably
rather
be
remembered
for
his
incredible
shows
His
pantomimes
fused
comedy
music
ballet
and
myth
into
tremendous
spectacles
provoking
us
Brits
to
have
a
moan
about
the
death
of
serious
theater
Jane
Moody
notes
that
although
actor/manager
David
Garrick
initially
joined
in
on
the
whining
he
was
sensible
enough
to
realize
there
was
money
to
be
had
in
this
tomfoolery
after
all
by
1732
John
Rich
was
able
to
build
Covent
Garden
Theater
with
his
profits
So
presumably
after
wrestling
with
his
artistic
conscience
Garrick
decided
that
If
they
won
t
come
to
Lear
and
Hamlet
I
must
give
them
Harlequin
He
compromised
by
only
producing
his
pantomimes
for
the
Christmas
season
associating
pantos
with
the
fun
of
Christmas
rather
than
proper
theater
The
Christmas
panto
tradition
survives
to
this
day
Things
developed
further
as
Britain
entered
the
Victorian
era
The
Industrial
Revolution
made
life
increasingly
difficult
for
the
working
class
and
the
local
Music
Hall
became
a
means
of
escape
As
Thompson
points
out
Beer
and
laughter
went
well
together…in
a
time
of
malnutrition
epidemics
and
a
cruel
penal
code
Performers
added
to
their
living
by
moving
away
from
the
Harlequinades
to
the
Music
Halls
and
developing
new
acts
the
pantomime
as
we
might
now
recognize
it
was
emerging
Although
the
issues
have
changed
since
the
Industrial
Revolution
the
panto
is
still
a
place
of
release
somewhere
to
laugh
at
your
problems
with
both
pantomimes
I
attended
making
fun
of
British
politics
and
COVID-19
Dick
Whittington
adapted
the
song
12
Days
of
Christmas
into
12
Days
of
Lockdown
On
the
sixth
day
of
Christmas
my
true
love
gave
to
me
six
lateral
flow
tests
five
toilet
rolls
four
booster
jabs
three
hand
sanitizers…
Meanwhile
the
villain
King
Rat
said
that
he
needed
a
wife
so
she
could
spend
inordinate
amounts
of
tax-payer
money
on
renovating
his
house
a
joke
referencing
a
recent
scandal
involving
Prime
Minister
Boris
Johnson
s
wife
Carrie
Symonds
Jeff
Bezos
doesn
t
escape
either
King
Rat
s
Ratazon
exploits
its
workers
and
destroys
local
businesses
and
over
in
Snow
White
her
engagement
to
Harry
provokes
quips
that
Prince
Harry
marrying
an
actress
will
never
work
In
Dick
Whittington
his
love
interest
proclaims
I
m
missing
Dick
to
knowing
chuckles
from
mothers
now
grasping
their
second
wine
The
key
to
these
jokes
is
being
able
to
speak
freely
not
always
a
given
in
a
traditional
monarchy
However
the
Theaters
Act
of
1843
indirectly
boosted
pantomime
by
lifting
restrictions
on
the
use
of
the
spoken
word
in
performances
and
limiting
the
powers
of
the
Lord
Chamberlain
to
only
prohibiting
plays
when
fitting
for
the
preservation
of
good
manners
decorum
or
of
the
public
peace
so
to
do
Wordplay
and
audience
participation
were
added
to
shows
shortly
thereafter
and
the
Victorians
did
not
stop
there
elaborate
sets
and
live
animals
added
to
the
theatrical
gimmicks
And
as
explained
by
the
Victoria
and
Albert
Museum
if
animals
were
not
available
people
would
do
some
actors
made
careers
of
dressing
in
elaborate
animal
costumes
known
as
skins
One
of
the
most
famous
Victorian
animal
impersonators
was
the
actor
and
acrobat
Charles
Lauri
Jr
He
had
quite
the
extensive
range
from
a
poodle
to
a
kangaroo
and
a
quote
attributed
to
him
demonstrates
the
true
method
actor
he
was
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
am
an
entire
believer
in
studying
from
life
When
getting
my
poodle
part
I
had
one
always
with
me
at
home
and
it
was
from
that
I
learned
nearly
all
my
tricks
By
the
end
of
the
century
productions
had
reached
an
epic
level
and
could
last
up
to
five
hours
FIVE
HOURS
You
could
walk
across
the
whole
of
London
and
Lauri
Jr
would
still
be
dressed
as
that
poodle
The
1900
Drury
Lane
production
of
Sleeping
Beauty
and
the
Beast
was
a
particularly
long
lavish
show
as
apparently
unable
to
pick
a
story
it
was
a
mash-up
of
both
Beauty
and
the
Beast
and
Sleeping
Beauty
A
critic
for
the
newspaper
The
Star
was
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
even
after
five
hours
of
consideration
The
Drury
Lane
pantomime…is
a
symbol
of
our
nation
It
is
the
biggest
thing
of
its
kind
in
the
world
it
is
a
prodigal
of
money
of
invention
of
splendor
of
men
and
women
but
it
is
without
the
sense
of
beauty
or
the
restraining
influence
of
taste
It
is
impossible
to
sit
in
the
theater
for
five
hours
without
being
filled
with
weary
admiration
Only
a
great
nation
could
have
done
such
a
thing
only
an
undisciplined
nation
would
have
done
it
The
monstrous
glittering
thing
of
pomp
and
humor
is
without
order
or
design
it
is
a
hotch-potch
of
everything
that
has
been
seen
on
any
stage
Hotch-potch
is
a
good
description
of
pantomime
a
bizarre
blend
of
continental
and
British
traditions
Professor
Jane
Moody
describes
it
as
The
raw
energy
of
Music
Hall
the
sauciness
of
Burlesque
the
acrobatic
power
of
John
Rich
and
the
archetypal
plots
of
Commedia…The
story
of
pantomime
is
a
story
of
transformation
and
endless
adaptation
It
still
is
The
pantomimes
I
saw
included
singing
dancing
improvisation
impersonation
and
acting
At
one
point
the
Evil
Queen
in
Snow
White
rode
a
pterodactyl
over
the
audience
an
impressive
theatrical
feat
but
not
a
point
I
remember
the
Brothers
Grimm
dwelling
on
A
sense
of
joy
radiates
off
the
stage
as
the
cast
gets
to
showcase
their
talents
and
tricks
led
by
the
star
of
the
show
the
Pantomime
Dame
Men
have
played
women
throughout
theater
history
with
female
performers
banned
from
the
stage
until
after
the
Restoration
in
1660
Pantomimes
stuck
with
that
convention
and
one
of
the
stars
is
still
a
man
dressed
as
a
careworn
mother
the
Dame
Dan
Leno
shaped
the
Dame
in
the
1880s
playing
roles
like
the
Queen
in
Humpty
Dumpty
or
Widow
Twankey
in
Aladdin
As
Jane
Moody
tells
it
he
began
to
domesticate
the
Dame
and
to
imagine
her
as
a
mother
facing
problems
which
he
and
his
audiences
knew
all
too
well
poverty
unemployment
and
abandonment
Nowadays
Moody
considers
the
Dame
to
embody
the
collective
ties
which
bind
us
together
as
families
as
neighbors
and
as
citizens
of
a
particular
town
or
city
The
Dame
is
often
played
by
a
big
star
Sir
Ian
McKellen
Les
Dawson
and
Christopher
Biggins
have
all
taken
a
turn
In
Snow
White
the
traditional
Dame
was
replaced
by
Gok
Wan
as
the
Mirror
who
at
one
point
lost
it
and
just
started
laughing
I
have
an
MBE
Two
weeks
ago
I
was
at
Windsor
Palace
and
now
I
m
on
my
hands
and
knees
in
Woking
Leave
it
After
the
performance
of
Dick
Whittington
a
Christmas
miracle
happened
with
a
little
help
from
the
press
relations
officer
and
my
sister
niece
and
I
got
to
meet
both
the
Dame
Sally
the
Cook
Peter
Gordon
and
the
baddie
King
Rat
Kit
Hesketh-Harvey
They
arrived
still
in
full
makeup
and
sat
with
us
in
the
stalls
while
cleaners
vacuumed
up
the
remnants
of
popcorn
and
tinsel
around
us
I
felt
a
little
starstruck
but
nothing
compared
to
my
14-year-old
niece
She
has
been
coming
to
this
pantomime
since
she
was
3
years
old
when
King
Rat
scared
her
so
much
she
was
carried
out
of
the
theater
in
floods
of
tears
Now
they
were
sitting
next
to
each
other
Oh
I
have
warped
the
minds
of
a
whole
generation
Hesketh-Harvey
said
with
relish
My
record
is
nine
children
screaming
with
fear
in
the
first
45
minutes
He
has
been
in
pantomime
for
12
years
Gordon
something
similar
They
are
both
local
and
even
remember
the
theater
being
built
The
theater
is
a
real
community
hub
says
Gordon
and
panto
is
its
lifeblood
The
regional
theater
would
go
under
without
panto
it
s
so
dependent
on
the
income
Hesketh-Harvey
agrees
Panto
is
just
so
important
It
s
a
huge
tradition
huge
You
get
these
baffled
Canadians
and
Americans
coming
and
they
just
don
t
get
it
But
it
s
the
last
great
variety
show…
a
time
to
come
together
and
celebrate
the
joy
of
community
and
create
family
memories
Besides
if
it
wasn
t
for
panto
we
would
just
be
two
old
farts
sitting
on
a
sofa
It
was
a
delight
to
sit
and
chat
with
these
two
gentlemen
the
villain
and
the
Dame
as
they
highlighted
some
of
the
things
I
had
experienced
for
myself
with
the
panto
the
history
the
sense
of
family
the
community
and
the
joy
in
laughing
at
life
But
after
a
two-year
hiatus
I
had
forgotten
how
risqué
pantomime
jokes
could
be
The
humor
is
reminiscent
of
the
British
Carry
On
films
but
this
was
a
series
that
ended
in
1992
Is
it
still
okay
for
Snow
White
to
be
Off
cottaging
with
seven
men
We
ve
all
been
there
Or
to
joke
I
m
dyslexic
but
I
ve
read
ten
out
of
two
people
are
Hesketh-Harvey
admits
that
Pantomime
and
woke
don
t
sit
well
together
Pantomime
gives
the
finger
to
the
woke
generation
but
the
joy
of
it
outweighs
everything
else
But
it
does
not
outweigh
everything
In
2017
Irene
Ng
expressed
serious
concerns
in
a
panel
event
hosted
by
The
Stage
Pantomime
makes
the
dominant
culture
or
color
feel
better
about
themselves
All
the
humor
was
taking
the
mick
out
of
people
in
a
derogatory
way
whether
someone
is
blind
handicapped
‘
ugly
or
of
a
different
race
Dongshin
Chang
an
academic
who
has
written
on
the
portrayal
of
Chinese
characters
on
the
London
stage
has
criticized
Aladdin
saying
the
character
names
in
Aladdin
are
rooted
in
dated
attitudes
towards
Chinese
people
Wishee
Washee
is
a
clear
reference
to
Chinese
business
interests…Underneath
the
fun
and
entertainment
the
association
with
laundry
may
also
be
considered
a
manifestation
of
prejudice
In
2017
a
mother
named
Natalie
Wood
made
an
official
complaint
about
Dick
Whittington
at
Manchester
Opera
House
saying
it
was
too
smutty
for
children
There
were
also
several
complaints
after
a
pantomime
advertised
for
a
Chow
Mein
Slave
of
the
Ring
for
a
production
of
Aladdin
She
has
been
coming
to
this
pantomime
since
she
was
3
years
old
when
King
Rat
scared
her
so
much
she
was
carried
out
of
the
theater
in
floods
of
tears
Now
they
were
sitting
next
to
each
other
Pantomime
is
in
a
bubble
but
it
still
needs
to
adapt
Hesketh-Harvey
may
grumble
that
It
s
amazing
what
I
can
t
say
this
year
but
I
was
impressed
with
some
of
the
changes
I
noticed
In
Snow
White
the
Prince
and
Snow
White
share
several
kisses
instigated
by
her
before
he
finally
wakes
her
from
her
slumber
with
an
unsolicited
kiss
Then
in
the
end
it
is
Snow
White
who
proposes
to
him
Spoiler
He
says
yes
The
dwarves
have
traditionally
been
played
by
little
people
but
in
this
production
they
were
a
hybrid
of
puppets
and
people
on
their
knees
which
still
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
And
in
Dick
Whittington
the
Black
female
lead
was
a
business
owner
who
at
the
end
of
the
production
wins
Business
Woman
of
the
Year
These
adaptations
although
small
are
signs
that
pantomime
is
changing
The
genre
continues
to

Thompson
says
‘
Once
Upon
a
Time
pantomimes
were
based
around
fairy
stories
such
as
Cinderella
Sleeping
Beauty
Jack
and
the
Beanstalk
but
increasingly
novels
and
films
are
being
adapted
for
the
stage
There
is
also
a
hint
of
Disneyfication
emerging
…
and
I
suspect
panto
will
continue
to
adapt
as
opinion
influences
it
To
survive
pantomime
needs
to
keep
transforming
but
it
will
it
has
been
adapting
for
the
last
500
years
In
a
few
weeks
the
Christmas
pantomime
season
will
be
drawing
to
a
close
But
my
season
isn
t
over
just
yet
newly
invigorated
by
my
experiences
I
have
now
agreed
to
both
a
stage
performance
of
Cinderella
as
well
as
a
radio
show
my
sister
is
performing
in
playing
an
Ugly
Sister
much
to
her
chagrin
But
rather
than
begrudge
giving
yet
more
time
over
to
panto
I
am
delighted
For
like
many
a
good
panto
plot
there
is
a
twist
this
is
a
redemption
story
In
Snow
White
when
the
Queen
declares
herself
the
fairest
in
the
land
I
shouted
Oh
no
you
re
not
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
when
Prince
Harry
has
a
ghost
behind
him
I
lent
further
lung
capacity
to
yelling
He
s
behind
you
In
Dick
Whittington
I
got
on
my
feet
with
the
rest
of
the
audience
and
sang
and
danced
to
Don
t
Stop
Believing
And
I
enjoyed
it
I
was
Scrooge
no
longer
I
now
understand
the
point
of
a
pantomime
It
brings
people
together
Not
only
does
the
history
of
pantomime
go
back
hundreds
of
years
but
it
goes
back
through
the
history
of
my
family
I
came
to
these
shows
as
a
child
and
now
I
go
with
my
nieces
and
nephews
We
have
created
family
memories
and
continue
creating
them
Panto
provides
a
sense
of
belonging
not
just
to
each
other
but
your
local
theater
and
your
local
town
And
after
a
difficult
two
years
it
is
so
lovely
to
laugh
My
niece
told
me
she
will
still
want
to
go
to
pantos
when
she
is
really
old
like
25
cringe
and
I
will
be
right
there
along
with
her
I
promise
I
will
never
walk
out
of
a
pantomime
again
Oh
no

a

singer
starting
with
the
first
time
they
met
in

Story
of

which
was
published
in
September
1993
the
same
month

third
and
final
album

encounters

show

Hannah
Dreier
spent
a
month
on
the
ground
reporting
this
story
about
a
California
couple
on
the
verge
of
being
kicked
out
of
FEMA
housing
their
refuge
in
the
wake
of
2018
s
devastating
Camp
Fire
With
the
clarity
and
compassion
that
are
the
hallmarks
of
her
work
Dreier
bears
witness
to
what
it
means
to
suffer
on
the
front
lines
of
climate
change
to
grapple
with
a
thinning
social
safety
net
and
after
all
that
to
stare
down
homelessness
She
portrays
the
couple
s
frustration
and
anger
as
well
as
their
love
and
resilience
But
why
Dreier
asks
is
this
happening
at
all
Doesn
t
the
government
owe
the
displaced
more
and
better
than
this
It
s
a
pressing
question
More
Americans
will
be
soon
displaced
by
fires
floods
and
extreme
weather
This
is
a
quiet
intimate
story
and
seemingly
small
in
scope
but
don
t
let
it
fool
you
it
offers
a
terrifying
glimpse
into

one

This

a
story
of
political
indifference
and

woefully
unequipped

much
of

Best
of
2021
year-end

By
Carolyn
Wells
As
the
plane
dipped
below
the
clouds
an
endless
patchwork
quilt
of
green
fields
and
russet
hedges
stretched
out
beneath
me
It
had
been
two
years
since
I
had
seen
that
familiar
vista
thanks
to
COVID-19
However
with
travel
restrictions
lifted
and
my
arm
triple-jabbed
I
was
finally
returning
from
expat
life
in
Canada
to
my
home
country
of
the
United
Kingdom
to
spend
three
months
with
family
Perhaps
it
is
because
it
has
been
so
long
since
my
last
visit
but
the
contrasts
between
North
America
and
this
gray
quirky
little
island
seem
more
pronounced
than
ever
Everything
is
so
much
smaller
the
tendencies
for
reservation
and
self-deprecation
so
much
clearer
and
even
more
cups
of
tea
are
offered
I
clutch
one
as
I
write
I
live
in
British
Columbia
a
British
colony
back
in
the
days
of
Queen
Victoria
with
her
government
s
dubious
penchant
for
claiming
large
chunks
of
the
world
Yet
despite
these
origins
the
differences
between
this
Canadian
province
and
the
British
Isles
are
as
vast
as
the
murky
ocean
separating
them
Perhaps
this
island
s
very
particular
culture
comes
from
the
hodgepodge
of
its
ancestry
From
the
Romans
to
the
Vikings
people
always
loved
a
good
ol
invasion
of
this
land
Or
maybe
it
s
simply
the
sense
of
history
Everywhere
I
turn
there
seems
to
be
an
ancient
stone
church
sitting
awkwardly
among
new
neighbors
swanky
bars
and
flats
Nip
to
a
pub
and
there
will
be
a
plaque
above
your
head
casually
informing
you
that
people
have
been
getting
drunk
in
that
establishment
since
1552
Whatever
the
reason
Great
Britain
is
an
obscure
place
and
one
that
has
inspired
some
interesting
writing
with
people
grappling
to
understand
the
different
elements
that
make
up
the
rather
bizarre
whole
And
so
whilst
I
am
embracing
stoicism
marmite
rain
and
real
ales
I
decided
it
was
time
for
the
Great
British
Reading
List
Laurie
Penny
has
also
experienced
the
differences
between
North
America
and
Great
Britain
after
spending
six
months
writing
TV
shows
in
Los
Angeles
However
her
understanding
of
the
two
cultures
by
far
transcends
my
own
In
this
essay
Penny
observes
the
Great
British
myth
cheerfully
portrayed
abroad
full
of
Queens
detectives
spies
castles
and
young
wizards
versus
the
reality
of
a
little
island
whose
power
on
the
world
stage
is
declining
where
poverty
inequality
and
disaster
nationalism
are
rising
The
imaginary
version
although
fascinatingly
dishonest
is
a
hypnotic
one
and
people
around
the
world
cozy
up
with
a
cup
of
tea
to
watch
the
reassuringly
gentle
Downton
Abbey
or
The
Great
British
Worried-People-Making-Cakes-in-a-Tent
Show
Penny
carefully
picks
apart
why
Brits
are
happy
to
let
this
grand
deception
continue
From
the
loss
of
the
Empire
to
the
reality
of
life
in
Britain
under
COVID-19
lockdowns
Brexit
and
Boris
Johnson
we
prefer
the
fantasy
version
Have
a
read
her
take
on
this
phenomenon
is
jolly
good
I
do
try
to
resist
the
temptation
to
make
fun
of
other
people
who
take
uncomplicated
joy
in
their
thing
The
British
do
this
a
lot
and
it
s
one
of
the
least
edifying
parts
of
the
national
character
Fandom
is
fine
Escapism
is
allowed
No
semi-sensitive
soul
can
be
expected
to
live
in
the
real
world
at
all
times
But
watching
the
whitewashed
revisionist
history
of
your
own
country
adopted
as
someone
else
s
fantasy
of
choice
is
actively
uncomfortable
It
s
like
sitting
by
while
a
decrepit
relative
gibbers
some
antediluvian
nonsense
about
the
good
old
days
and
watching
in
horror
as
everyone
applauds
and
says
how
charming
During
my
first
week
back
in
the
U.
K
I
went
to
the
great
British
seaside
It
was
beautiful
It
was
also
freezing
Nevertheless
families
were
picnicking
on
the
beach
sitting
in
their
North
Face
jackets
under
huge
umbrellas
stoically
munching
on
cheese
and
pickle
sandwiches
while
the
wind
beat
a
dance
on
their
striped
windbreakers
We
were
one
of
them
And
as
the
wind
turned
up
a
notch
into
gale
force
blowing
the
ice
cream
off
my
Mr
Whippy
cone
I
recalled
Monica
Heisey
s
article
for
The
Guardian
detailing
a
holiday
she
went
on
with
three
Brits
As
a
Canadian
this
was
her
first
experience
of
a
British
holiday
and
I
very
much
enjoyed
her
shock
at
the
pragmatism
involved
in
holidaying
in
a
country
where
the
ground
is
soggy
and
the
sky
grey
at
least
60
%
of
the
year
On
Heisey
s
holiday
they
went
on
long
aimless
walks
every
single
day
from
a
half-hour
jaunt
on
a
public
footpath
across
a
gated
excrement-riddled
field
to
an
off-piste
ramble
through
the
tall
dry
grasses
surrounding
a
stately
home
This
is
completely
normal
My
family
had
begun
muttering
about
lovely
coastal
walks
months
before
we
left
for
our
seaside
break
and
sure
enough
every
day
we
donned
knee-high
wellies
and
marched
off
to
check
on
what
those
wind
levels
were
up
to
on
more
exposed
coastal
paths
On
a
couple
of
occasions
treating
ourselves
to
a
cup
of
tea
halfway
round
the
trudge
Heisey
nails
her
critique
of
British
culture
and
I
found
myself
chuckling
more
than
once
reading
this
article
So
take
a
look
and
remember
to
always
just
carry
on
the
forecast
of
heavy
thunderstorms
be
damned
I
am
it
seems
comfortably
in
the
minority
After
the
Great
Walking
Holiday
of
2020
I
encountered
pro-walking
sentiment
everywhere
Friends
tracked
steps
with
competitive
rigor
fighting
to
be
the
first

reach
10k
a
day
or

Sunday
schemes
to
cross
London
on
foot
Planning
a
weekend
in
Herefordshire
I
was
inundated
with
recommendations
for
the
county
s
excellent
walks
In
fact
Airbnb
reviews
in
the
UK
tend
to
focus
on
two
things
whether
or
not
the
property
provides
an
adequate
electric
kettle
and
the
quality
and
abundance
of
nearby
walking
routes
Recently
watching
The
Crown
on
Netflix
I
had
the
disorienting
and
novel
experience
of
feeling
sympathy
for
Margaret
Thatcher
who
in
an
episode
set
at
Balmoral
is
dragged
out
on
the
royal
family
s
favourite
pastime
walking
around
in
terrible
weather
wearing
the
thickest
socks
imaginable
Great
Britain
is
not
particularly
renowned
for
splendid
cuisine
but
there
are
some
classics
the
full
English
breakfast
a
roast
dinner
a
ploughman
s
lunch
bangers
and
mash
a
jar
of
Branston
pickle
…
and
marmalade
Full
disclosure
I
have
picked
this
essay
before
for

Food
However
I
still
love
it
and
last
week
it
came
to
mind
when
I
had
the
pleasure
of
going
to
a
shop
that
was
purely
dedicated
to
the
wonder
of
marmalade
Rows
upon
rows
of
glinting
orange
and
yellow
jars
winking
promises
of
citrus
delights
at
me
Olivia
Potts
piece
all
about
this
condiment
of
squashed
oranges
and
sugar
is
magical
and
very
British
Only
in
English
does
marmalade
connote
a
citrus-based
preserve
containing
peel
and
Potts
takes
a
deep
dive
into
why
the
British
love
marmalade
so
much
The
result
is
a
lovely
piece
full
of
warmth
humor
…
and
the
rather
wonderful
characters
who
frequent
the
World
s
Original
Marmalade
Awards
I
stand
back
and
admire
my
five-and-a-half
jars
and…
I
get
it
Of
course
I
do
How
could
I
not
My
jelly
isn
t
quite
crystal
clear
but
it
is
basketball
orange
bright
and
glowing
I
dropped
saffron
strands
into
a
couple
of
the
jars
stirring
last
minute
and
they
hang
suspended
in
the
jelly
perfect
threads
It
may
not
be
award-winning
but
it
is
the
best
I
have
ever
made
It
really
does
feel
like
I
ve

a

Great

be
the
home
of
quaint
villages
with
marmalade
shops
but
you
are
also
never

far
away
from

London

a

all
of
its

encircled
by
the

a

to
crush
even
the

with
its

it
is
a
heady
mix

every
culture

There

look
like
cleaning

homes
feels
a
bit
Miss
Marple-ish
Her
eloquent
writing
evokes
the
chaos
loneliness
sadness
and
joy
of
the
people
to
whom
she
is
East
London
s
good
wife
Kirsch
s
musings
also
brought
back
memories
of
my
own
time
living
in
London
from
Shoreditch
being
the
unofficial
home
of
the
high-maintenance
beard
to
the
darker
side
the
casual
racism
that
can
sadly
still
prevail
in
a
multicultural
country
Kirsch
notes
it
when
a
friend
s
9-year-old
son
asks
her
what
she
does
and
to
her
response
that
she
cleans
houses
he
said
‘
I
thought
you
had
to
be
Eastern
European
to
do
that
No
offense
So
take
a
read
for
a
glimpse
into
London
life
the
unique
viewpoint
and
beautiful
prose
of
this
essay
are
worth
spending
some
time
with
As
well
as
working
for
long-term
clients
I
do
one-off
jobs
often
frantic
pleas
to
clean
up
before
a
move
or
before
the
tidy
person
gets
home
One
was
a
flat
off
Brick
Lane
This
was
a
biohazard
job
matted
badly
stained
carpets
never-been-cleaned
fridge
and
cooker
loo
out
of
Trainspotting
But
the
guy
himself
was
ebullient
friends
with
all
the
neighbours
He
just
exuded
a
joie
de
vivre
and
genuinely
did
not
see
or
care
that
he
had
been
living
in
a
shithole
for
years
Facing
a
big
brown
dubious
stain
on
his
carpet
I
asked
Is
this
poo
vomit
or
curry
Possibly
all
three
he
said
honestly
gleefully
A
life
well
lived
Messily
but
happily
Sadly
the
racism
touched
upon
in
Kirsch
s
essay
came
crashing
to
the
fore
in
2016
I
was
living
in
Canada
during
Brexit
and
absorbed
in
the
echo
chamber
of
friends
and
family
I
considered
the
referendum
on
whether
Britain
should
leave
the
European
Union
a
mere
political
blip
As
Zadie
Smith
writes
in
her
incredibly
astute
and
of-the-moment
piece
Nigel
Farage
one
of
the
main
forces
behind
the
Leave
campaign
seemed
in
the
grip
of
a
genuine
racial
obsession
combined
with
a
determination
to
fence
off
Britain
from
the
European
mainstream
It
didn
t
seem
possible
to
me
that
this
was
a
sentiment
that
could
win
the
day
I
was
wrong
In
truth
the
reasons
behind
Brexit
are
varied
but
the
process
of
the
vote
did
peel
back
a
thin
veneer
to
reveal
an
ugliness
beneath
The
week
before
the
referendum
Smith
s
Jamaican-born
mother
had
someone
run
up
to
her
in
London
and
shout
Über
Alles
Deutschland
The
day
after
the
vote
Smith
noted
a
lady
shopping
for
linens
and
towels
on
the
Kilburn
High
Road
stood
near
my
mother
and
the
half-dozen
other
people
originally
from
other
places
and
announced
to
no
one
in
particular
‘
Well
you
ll
all
have
to
go
home
now
It
was
not
only
racial
divides
that
were
uncovered
Britain
has
long
been
a
society
dominated
by
class
with
nuanced
differences
between
many
invisible
but
powerful
lines
From
the
working
class
to
the
neoliberal
middle
and
upper-middle
class
reveal
where
you
shop
go
to
school
or
who
you
socialize
with
and
you
can
be
exposed
In
this
essay
Smith
recognizes
both
her
own
middle-class
liberal
attitude
and
the
understanding
of
other
viewpoints
that
this
can
preclude
her
from
Read
this
essay
and
understand
that
the
power
of
this
referendum
was
to
magnify
the
worst
aspects
of
an
already
imperfect
system—democracy—channeling
a
dazzlingly
wide
variety
of
issues
through
a
very
narrow
gate
Wealthy
London
whether
red
or
blue
has
always
been
able
to
pick
and
choose
the
nature
of
its
multicultural
and
cross-class
relations
to
lecture
the
rest
of
the
country
on
its
narrow-mindedness
while
simultaneously
fencing
off
its
own
discreet
advantages
We
may
walk
past
them
very
often
in
the
street
and
get
into
their
cabs
and
eat
their
food
in
their
ethnic
restaurants
but
the
truth
is
that
more
often
than
not
they
are
not
in
our
schools
or
in
our
social
circles
and
they
very
rarely
enter
our
houses—unless
they
ve
come
to
work
on
our
endlessly
remodeled
kitchens
Britain
is
a
nation
of
animal
lovers
It
was
the
first
country
in
the
world
to
start
a
welfare
charity
for
animals
and
almost
one
in
two
households
has
a
pet
20
million
of
them
being
cats
and
dogs
In
the
area
I
am
in
at
the
moment
it
seems
this
20
million
quota
has
been
filled
just
with
cockapoo
dogs
named
Barney
yes
we
have
one
too
Fifteen
percent
of
Brits
even
say
they
love
their
pet
more
than
they
love
their
partner
a
statistic
I
am
not
shocked
by
after
my
mother
informed
me
she
wished
to
be
buried
with
the
cremated
remains
of
her
pet
duck
Therefore
it
is
also
of
no
surprise
that
Phil
Hoad
s
fascinating
article
delving
into
the
world
of
two
pet
detectives
searching
for
a
cat
murderer
is
set
in
Britain
In
this
country
such
things
as
a
memorial
service
for
the
cat
victims
complete
with
a
harpist
and
a
rendition
of
All
Things
Bright
and
Beautiful
are
acceptable
people
understand
the
passion
of
the
detectives
Tony
Jenkins
and
Boudicca
Rising
Their
organization
SNARL
has
even
been
supported
by
British
celebrities
including
Top
Gear
s
Jeremy
Clarkson
who
wrote
in
The
Sun
I
m
not
a
cat
fan
by
any
means—they
give
me
asthma—and
I
can
t
think
of
anything
worse
than
spending
time
in
the
company
of
an
animal-rights
person
called
Boudicca
Rising
The
case
makes
my
blood
boil
because
I
am
a
dog
fan
And
if
someone
poisoned
mine
I
d
capture
him
and
force
him
to
live
for
a
year
with
Boudicca
Rising
This
whodunnit
at
times
made
me
both
sad
and
angry
after
all
I
too
am
a
British
animal
lover
but
it
is
a
rollercoaster
ride
and
a
beautiful
read
Jenkins
worried
that
too
often
the
media
furor
minimized
the
impact
of
the
killings
on
pet
owners
I
had
one
police
officer
who
went
‘
Waste
of
my
time—it
s
only
a
cat
I
said
‘
Excuse
me
It
s
only
a
cat
Jenkins
told
me
Imagine
you
get
married
and
your
wife
gets
a
cat
You
then
have
a
child
and
your
child
at
the
age
of
six
has
grown
up
with
it
adores
it
sleeps
with
it
And
one
morning
your
wife
gets
up
opens
the
curtains
and
there
s
your
cat
with
no
head
and
no
fucking
tail
and
your
daughter
s
about
to
go
out
and
play
And
you
tell
me
it
s
just
a
fucking
cat
By
Carolyn
Wells
It
had
been
so
long
since
I
had
walked
down
those
steps
into
a
poorly
lit
foyer
with
low-hanging
ceiling
tiles
where
the
scent
of
buttery
popcorn
filled
the
stagnant
air
and
posters
hung
limply
off
the
walls
That
s
right
I
went
to
my
local
cinema
I
actually
saw
a
film
with
other
people
on
a
big
screen
and
wore
proper
outdoor
clothes
After
nearly
two
years
of
viewings
from
my
sofa
largely
in
pajamas
this
felt
unnerving
and
exciting
Granted
the
seats
were
still
uncomfortable
the
chocolate
was
still
overpriced
and
a
large
family
walked
in
late
discussed
loudly
where
to
sit
and
then
chose
the
seats
right
in
front
of
me
But
there
was
also
surround
sound
laughter
and
Daniel
Craig
COVID-19
had
kept
No
Time
To
Die
the
latest
James
Bond
film
out
of
the
cinemas
for
as
long
as
it
had
me
it
was
supposed
to
be
released
in
April
2020
but
when
cinemas
shut
down
around
the
world
007
or
at
least
Universal
Pictures
refused
to
stoop
so
low
as
a
streaming
platform
And
so
we
waited
It
was
worth
it
it
s
a
good
film
and
improbable
car
chases
across
dramatic
snowy
landscapes
do
lose
something
outside
of
the
big
screen
I
found
myself
wondering
what
brand
of
winter
tire
he
uses
very
grippy
Although
I
don
t
proclaim
to
be
a
particularly
ardent
James
Bond
fan
watching
an
aging
Daniel
Craig
strut
his
stuff
did
make
me
start
to
ponder
the
incredible
longevity
of
this
franchise
We
had
waited
a
year
and
a
half
for
this
film
but
that
s
nothing
to
a
spy
who
has
been
in
the
field
since
1952
James
Bond
has
always
been
in
my
subconscious
Growing
up
in
the
UK
there
were
four
TV
channels
and
I
remember
the
films
on
all
of
them
around
Christmas
the
broadcasters
having
decided
we
deserved
a
treat
at
that
time
of
year
First
it
was
Roger
Moore
arching
his
eyebrow
at
me
then
he
gave
way
to
a
smooth
Pierce
Brosnan
who
my
mum
excitedly
ordained
rather
dishy
Moore
and
Brosnan
were
my
Bonds
I
had
missed
the
very
start
the
era
of
Sean
Connery
and
so
my
curiosity
piqued
after
my
cinema
trip
I
decided
to
dig
deep
into
my
streaming
platforms
and
watch
a
Sean
Connery
classic
Goldfinger
It
s
from
1964
so
I
was
not
expecting
the
production
values
to
be
particularly
high
and
I
was
duly
rewarded
in
the
first
scene
when
Connery
appeared
with
a
bedraggled
stuffed
seagull
on
his
head
as
a
disguise
We
quickly
move
on
to
him
kissing
a
woman
sans
seagull
when
he
sees
someone
with
a
hammer
sneaking
up
on
them
reflected
in
her
eye
impressive
at
such
close
range
and
in
an
incredibly
unchivalrous
move
he
swings
the
woman
round
so
that
the
man
whacks
her
on
the
head
rather
than
him
And
this
was
all
before
the
opening
credits
It
gets
worse
In
one
scene
007
is
getting
a
massage
by
the
pool
and
just
as
he
creepily
asks
the
masseuse
to
go
a
bit
lower
a
guy
comes
up
to
speak
to
him
Connery
I
kid
you
not
tells
the
masseuse
to
shove
off
it
s
man
talk
and
proceeds
to
slap
her
bottom
as
she
exits
He
then
pulls
on
a
hot
pants
onesie
apparently
made
out
of
a
used
towel
a
look
he
deserves
at
this
point
It
gets
more
troubling
later
when
he
pushes
Pussy
Galore
into
a
hay
pile
and
forcibly
kisses
her
as
she
tries
to
fight
him
off
By
the
time
Goldfinger
has
him
tied
to
a
table
with
a
laser
beam
tracking
toward
his
penis
I
m
rooting
for
the
laser
beam
In
contrast
No
Time
To
Die
does
not
even
open
with
Bond
but
with
a
little
girl
who
when
chased
by
a
villain
pulls
a
gun
out
and
shoots
right
back
A
retired
James
has
also
been
replaced
by
a
new
007
a
Black
woman
While
it
is
impossible
to
apply
today
s
values
to
a
film
from
the
early
60s
I
am
pretty
happy
that
being
dismissed
with
a
quick
bum
slap
is
no
longer
acceptable
and
the
stark
differences
between
the
two
films
made
me
again
appreciate
just
how
long
Bond
has
been
around
When
he
first
pulled
out
his
gun
on-screen
it
was
a
very
different
world
and
that
license
to
kill
still
hasn
t
expired
How
has
someone
who
is
a
borderline
rapist
a
murderer
and
a
potential
sociopath
endured
through
all
these
decades
We
could
consider
the
fact
that
all
the
films
share
the
same
enjoyable
elements
it
s
always
fun
to
hang
out
in
an
exotic
beach
location
drive
beautiful
mountain
roads
and
then
pop
home
to
share
some
quips
in
a
British
government
office
Villains
with
metal
teeth
white
cats
or
dubious
accents
have
a
certain
timeless
appeal
and
submarine
cars
magnetic
watches
or
X-ray
sunglasses
are
always
cool
And
then
there
is
the
music
the
iconic
theme
songs
have
an
attraction
all
of
their
own
I
particularly
remember
Madonna
s
Die
Another
Day
due
mostly
to
my
younger
self
crashing
my
dad
s
car
while
trying
to
dance
along
to
the
bizarre
techno
part
Do
not
dance
and
drive
however
fun
the
song
may
be
There
are
many
other
classics
One
of
the
few
times
in
Goldfinger
where
a
woman
is
actually
allowed
to
shine
is
Shirley
Bassey
singing
the
theme
song
It
s
magnificent
However
the
locations
the
gadgets
and
even
the
songs
can
not
be
enough
to
keep
this
unwieldy
franchise
going
So
let
s
look
at
how
it
started
with
a
rather
posh
English
chap
called
Ian
Fleming
He
penned
the
first
007
novel
Casino
Royale
in
1952
and
proceeded
to
write
another
11
Bond
novels
and
two
short
story
collections
The
timeline
in
these
books
is
rather
vague
but
Bond
s
penchant
for
cars
drinking
and
women
remains
consistent
It
was
a
successful
formula
and
Fleming
sold
30
million
books
in
his
lifetime
although
it
wasn
t
until
after
his
death
that
Bond
entered
a
whole
new
medium
with
an
American
film
producer
named
Albert
Cubby
Broccoli
first
bringing
the
character
to
screen
in
1962
under
his
production
company
Eon
Productions
Unbelievably
Bond
never
left
the
tight
grip
of
the
Broccoli
clan
58
years
after
Bond
s
first
outing
the
producers
of
No
Time
To
Die
are
Albert
s
daughter
Barbara
Broccoli
and
stepson
Michael
G
Wilson
Albert
having
handed
the
Aston
Martin
keys
over
to
them
back
in
1995
This
is
a
family
dynasty
that
likes
control
No
Time
to
Die
was
originally
supposed
to
be
directed
by
Danny
Boyle
who
brought
along
his
regular
writer
John
Hodge
This
didn
t
work
out
so
well
Hodge
s
script
was
rejected
and
Boyle
quit
stating
The
producers
wanted
to
go
in
a
different
direction
The
Broccolis
weren
t
happy
there
was
no
way
he
could
stay
I
think
it
is
this
iron
control
that
is
the
key
to
Bond
s
success
The
Broccolis
know
what
they
are
doing
after
all
the
family
has
been
doing
it
for
nearly
60
years
They
have
been
the
ones
to
choose
the
lead
the
director
the
locations
and
now
they
have
finished
Ian
Fleming
s
material
the
stories
A
2015
New
York
Times
interview
revealed
that
the
creative
process
begins
with
Barbara
and
Michael
trying
to
decide
on
a
premise
and
a
villain
that
can
embody
some
topical
issue
or
prevalent
fear
This
is
critical
Their
Bond
films
change
to
reflect
the
world
they
are
going
to
be
viewed
in
It
was
a
strategy
first
started
by
Albert
Broccoli
When
Star
Wars
turned
space
into
a
trend
007
also
reached
for
the
stars
in
1979
s
Moonraker
And
as
Dr
Jaap
Verheul
editor
of
The
Cultural
Life
of
James
Bond
has
said
Each
time
a
new
actor
becomes
Bond
the
series
takes
the
opportunity
to
recalibrate
itself
to
the
ideology
of
the
audience
it
s
trying
to
talk
to
Michael
Wilson
and
Barbara
Broccoli
did
just
that
after
brutally
dismissing
my
mum
s
crush
Pierce
Brosnan
In
1997
Austin
Powers
International
Man
of
Mystery
rather
wonderfully
satirized
the
movies
making
things
groovier
but
much
harder
for
Brosnan
s
rather
tongue-in-cheek
style
to
continue
working
Then
9/11
happened
and
the
Broccolis
felt
the
world
needed
a
rougher
darker
Bond
A
thug
with
hidden
complexities
Brosnan
had
to
go
They
wanted
Daniel
Craig
With
this
reinvention
some
of
the
more
unpalatable
elements
of
Bond
were
also
tackled
for
example
in
Casino
Royale
Bond
s
drinking
is
portrayed
for
the
first
time
as
a
coping
mechanism
for
his
internalized
guilt
During
this
dive
into
the
world
of
007
I
discovered
that
one
of
my
favorite
writers
Phoebe
Waller-Bridge
the
star
of
Fleabag
had
worked
on
the
script
of
No
Time
to
Die
She
has
said
of
Craig
s
portrayal
of
Bond
that
he
let
us
in
a
bit
which
makes
the
moments
he
shuts
us
out
even
more
arresting
…
Overall
he
grounded
a
fantasy
character
in
real
emotion
which
is
what
I
think
we
hadn
t
realized
we
d
missed
amongst
the
action
and
the
bravado
So
basically
with
Daniel
Craig
Bond
isn
t
all
about
the
arse-slapping
In
fact
this
Bond
actually
falls

What
I
didn
t
realize
at
first
as
I
sat
in
the
cinema
somewhat
confused
having
missed
the
preceding
film
Spectre
is
that
the
Craig
films
also
follow
on
from
each
other
in
a
series
so
for
the
first
time
Bond
even
ages
as
well
But
even
as
James
Bond
gets
older
he
is
still
never
diluted
the
Broccolis
don
t
allow
any
spin-off
shows
where
M
is
venturing
out
to
run
a
start-up
spy
business
It
s
always
all
about
007
These
producers
are
smart
They
know
how
to
handle
their
baby
No
Time
To
Die
is
Craig
s
last
film
as
007
and
the
rumor
mill
of
who
will
be
next
has
started
with
some
speculation
that
it
could
even
be
a
woman
next
time
round
I
don
t
think
it
will
be
The
Broccolis
have
a
good
thing
going
Bond
is
invariably
going
to
be
a
white
guy
there
was
enough
backlash
when
he
went
blonde
but
they
will
make
sure
to
always
keep
shifting
him
just
enough
to
make
sure
he
is
palatable
to
the
audience
whatever
decade
we
are
in
And
with
the
next
generation
of
Broccolis
already
in
the
business
I
suspect
there
will
be
many
more
During
my
research
for
this
post
I
came
across
three
particular
long-form

that
I
enjoyed

Disney
often
codes
their
villains
as
queer
This
is
widely
known
and
accepted
First
noticed
by
scholars
during
the
Disney
Renaissance
of
the
late
‘
80s
through
the
‘
90s
critical
observations
about
characters
like
Scar
The
Lion
King
have
since
disseminated
into
pithy
viral
tweets
and
TikToks
A
quick
Google
search
of
gay
Disney
villains
will
turn
up
dozens
of
articles
all
repeating
the
same
litany
of
facts
That
The
Little
Mermaid
s
Ursula
is
based
on
the
iconic
drag
queen
Divine
that
Hollywood
often
uses
British
accents
and
effeminate
mannerisms
in
men
like
Robin
Hood
s
King
John
to
signal
moral
decrepitude
But
those
are
observations
without
analysis
which
is
to
say
pointing
out
the
obvious
without
asking
why
or
how
The
subtext
of
these
clickbait
articles
and
listicles
is
often
Disney
codes
villains
as
queer
because
Disney
thinks
being
gay
is
bad
Which
is
one
way
to
read
it
However
simply
saying
Disney
is
bigoted
has
never
sat
entirely
well
with
me
for
one
reason
In
spite
of
what
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
may
rule
Disney
is
not
a
person
Disney
is
a
corporation
that
wields
the
power
of
a
nation-state
and
consequently
has
one
central
obsession
the
preservation
and
expansion
of
that
power
a
theme
that
is
prevalent
and
evident
in
every
story
they
allow
their
employees
and
contractors
to
tell
If
queerness
is
consistently
coded
a
certain
way
it
has
something
to
do
with
how
Disney
wants
power
to
function
who
can
wield
it
and
how
Millennials
are
the
generation
whose
childhoods
were
shaped
by
the
stories
of
the
Disney
Renaissance
a
period
generally
considered
to
have
begun
with
1989
s
The
Little
Mermaid
and
concluded
with
1999
s
Tarzan
It
includes
favorites
like
Aladdin
Beauty
and
the
Beast
and
Mulan
which
incidentally
are
at
the
heart
of
the
corporation
s
live-action
remake
strategy
intended
to
further
monetize
a
now-grown
generation
s
nostalgia
for
the
stories
that
formed
us
stories
we
can
share
with
our
own
children
or
group
texts
The
Disney
Renaissance
was
birthed
after
a
decade
of
HIV/AIDS
ravaging
queer
communities
its
height
marked
by
political
milestones
such
as
President
Clinton
s
signing
of
the
Defense
of
Marriage
Act
1996
and
the
institution
of
Don
t
Ask
Don
t
Tell
for
LGBTQ+
members
of
the
military
Divergent
non-normative
sexuality
was
purportedly
a
threat
to
society
and
Disney
ever
the
quiet
institutional
soldier
answered
by
providing
a
veritable
stable
of
queer-coded
villains
who
were
ill-suited
to
lead
or
assume
power
Indeed
there
were
so
many
queer-coded
villains
in
this
period
that
it
s
hard
to
remember
them
all
let
alone
the
different
lessons
they
taught
us
To
wit
you
probably
remember
Scar
Jafar
and
Ursula
but
you
have
probably
forgotten
Governor
Ratcliffe
from
1995
s
Pocahontas
the
fashion-conscious
social-climbing
crown-appointed
governor
in
charge
of
the
colonizing
mission
to
the
New
World
Pocahontas
has
one
of
the
top-five
highest-grossing
Disney
soundtracks
of
all
time
but
that
s
generally
where
any
lingering
nostalgia
dies
To
say
that
the
film
itself
is
problematic
is
an
understatement
While
the
screenshot
of
Chief
Powhatan
Pocahontas
father
saying
these
white
men
are
dangerous
has
found
a
rich
afterlife
on
social
media
the
film
s
historical
inaccuracy
and
deliberate
whitewashing
of
colonization
and
its
aftermath
have
cycled
it
out
of
many
a
millennial
s
comfort
film
rotation
something
that
has
generally
gone
unaddressed
by
the
corporation
The
fact
that
Mel
Gibson
voiced
John
Smith
hasn
t
helped
either
Pocahontas
may
seem
like
a
strange
vehicle
for
discussing
queer
villainy
But
that
s
the
thing
Disney
gets
inventive
when
they
need
to
circumvent
white
people
s
historical
responsibility
for
genocidal
atrocities
and
what
better
way
to
do
that
than
to
displace
the
heart
of
the
film
s
conflict
onto
contemporary
cultural
anxiety
queerness
and
its
incumbent
specter
masculinity
Divergent
non-normative
sexuality
was
purportedly
a
threat
to
society
and
Disney
ever
the
quiet
institutional
soldier
answered
by
providing
a
veritable
stable
of
queer-coded
villains
who
were
ill-suited
to
lead
or
assume
power
Disney
s
attitudes
toward
colonization
and
queer
coding
are
it
turns
out
inextricably
linked
By
using
a
queer-coded
villain
the
corporation
entirely
elides
white
responsibility
in
retelling
a
historical
tragedy
letting
the
cowboy-type
colonizers
off
the
hook
for
any
wrongdoing
and
instead
reframing
them
as
the
heroes
of
the
story
In
Pocahontas
Disney
pulls
off
the
magic
trick
of
telling
a
story
about
colonization
and
genocide
where
the
only
thing
that
s
actually
punished
is
the
wrong
kind
of
masculinity
Governor
Ratcliffe
is
not
set
up
as
the
villain
because
he
is
a
colonizer
or
even
because
he
is
in
charge
of
the
mission
to
invade
the
Powhatan
nation
or
as
Disney
has
framed
it
dig
for
gold
To
criticize
him
for
these
positions
would
implicate
and
damage
the
purported
heroism
of
every
other
white
character
on
screen
Something
else
then
must
indicate
his
villainy
and
Ratcliffe
violates
Disney
s
favorite
American
norms
individualism
hard
work
modesty
immediately
He
wears
bows
in
his
hair
and
a
literal
feather
in
his
cap
His
twinky
manservant
Wiggins
helps
dress
him
and
is
even
in
charge
of
bathing
his
dog
…
and
let
s
take
a
moment
to
discuss
the
dog
Unless
fighting
Ratcliffe
is
rarely
seen
not
carrying
his
white
pug
Percy
who
is
always
adorned
in
a
collar
that
is
fancier
than
anything
the
crew
are
wearing
Disney
villains
animal
familiars
tell
us
something
about
their
personality
and
Percy
s
taste
for
luxury
speaks
volumes
about
Ratcliffe
s
lifestyle
Ratcliffe
prefers
to
delegate
rather
than
do
physical
labor
himself
a
standard
managerial
practice
but
not
something
heroes
do
He
belittles
his
workers
when
things
don
t
go
well
seeing
his
crew
as
a
means
to
an
end
and
insulting
them
as
witless
peasants
behind
closed
doors
The
narrative
works
to
align
the
audience
s
viewpoint
with
that
of
the
other
colonizers
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
laborers
Look
at
us
No
gold
no
food
while
Ratcliffe
sits
in
his
tent
all
day
happy
as
a
clam
The
audience
is
clearly
meant
to
sympathize
with
the
worker
instead
of
Ratcliffe
the
villainous
manager
even
if
that
worker
is
also
occupying
stolen
land
and
explicitly
fantasizing
about
killing
Indigenous
people
What
audience
exactly
is
this
for
You

the

Please

Every

Yes
I
d
like
to
contribute
However
it
isn
t
just
that
Ratcliffe
is
a
bullying
well-dressed
boss
in
an
environment
where
no
one
is
impressed
by
designer
wares
He
s
deeply
insecure
and
concerned
about
what
other
people
think
as
opposed
to
the
naturally
popular
carefree
everyman
that
is
the
Captain
of
the
ship
and
Pocahontas
eventual
love
interest
John
Smith
In
fact
we
learn
that
this
mission
is
something
of
a
last-ditch
effort
to
salvage
Ratcliffe
s
reputation
with
the
king
For
him
success
means
falling
in
line
trying
to
do
right
by
the
crown
to
reap
the
reward
When
he
says
it
s
not
that
I
m
bitter
we
understand
that
he
is
in
fact
deeply
bitter
Ratcliffe
s
real
fantasy
is
power
bringing
his
enemies
at
court
to
heel
being
so
celebrated
that
My
dear
friend
King
Jimmy
will
probably
build
me
a
shrine
precisely
because
he
feels
so
ironically
powerless
This
is
not
the
kind
of
chaotic
burn-it-all-down
villain
who
has
been
canonized
by
drag
shows
A
casual
Google
search
reveals
that
Ratcliffe
does
not
even
show
up
on
most
Gay
Disney
Villain
lists
Something
about
him
elides
memory
and
decisive
categorization
as
other
encouraging
a
certain
slippage
He
isn
t
as
easy
to
pin
down
as
the
Queer
Villains
of
Excess
the
Scars
and
Ursulas
who
you
can
spot
by
their
muchness
their
refusal
to
conform
to
rigid
social
structures
their
wild
desire
to
usurp
the
throne
Excess
is
the
singular
quality
that
usually
drives
queer-coded
villains
to
crave
power
at
all
costs
their
appetites
monstrous
and
unnatural
Ironically
even
the
most
chaotic
queer-coded
villains
are
rarely
bent
on
creating
their
own
power
structures
they
only
ever
desire
the
kingdom
and
seemingly
the
lives
of
their
straight-coded
heroic
counterparts
Jafar
wants
to
be
sultan
but
has
no
conception
of
what
to
do
with
that
power
once
obtained
to
the
point
he
can
not
strategize
enough
to
realize
that
the
genie
is
beholden
to
others
Scar
believes
himself
to
be
the
rightful
ruler
of
the
Pride
Lands
only
to
drive
the
kingdom
into
a
barren
wasteland
The
queer
failure
of
reproduction
on
which
society
so
purportedly
rests
made
manifest
Fuck
the
social
order
and
the
child
in
whose
name
we
re
collectively
terrorized
queer
theorist
Lee
Edelman
writes
in
No
Future
the
anthem
of
Disney
villains
everywhere
Disney
gets
inventive
when
they
need
to
circumvent
white
people
s
historical
responsibility
for
genocidal
atrocities
and
what
better
way
to
do
that
than
to
displace
the
heart
of
the
film
s
conflict
onto
contemporary
cultural
anxiety
queerness
and
its
incumbent
specter
masculinity
The
opposite
of
excess
is
moderation
and
restraining
oneself
to
fit
into
the
boxes
society
has
prescribed
well
this
is
assimilation
Assimilation
is
when
a
group
of
people
assumes
the
values
behaviors
and
beliefs
of
another
group
when
something
core
and
essential
to
one
s
culture
and
sense
of
self
and
identity
is
lost
in
the
interest
of
resembling
the
social
majority
In
the
U.
S.
this
has
had
many
iterations
around
the
suppression
of
non-English
languages
the
forced
Christianization
of
Indigenous
peoples
and
more
For
the
LGBTQ+
community
it
looks
like
our
communities
having
been
largely
underground
until
the
last
50
or
so
years
because
social
legibility
meant
imprisonment
exile
or
death
In
many
ways
for
many
people
various
forms
of
assimilation
are
pure
survival
in
a
white
heteronormative
and
otherwise
profoundly
difficult
world
But
assimilation
used
against
one
s
own
community
assimilation
used
to
turn
the
target
off
your
own
back
and
toward
communities
with
less
cultural
power
than
yours
becomes
an
alliance
with
the
oppressor
Ratcliffe
is
a
queer-coded
villain
whose
trademark
is
assimilation
not
excess
This
is
why
he
slips
and
slides
through
millennial
memory
hard
to
remember
hard
to
pin
down
He
isn
t
an
outsider
an
icon
to
queer
children
everywhere
an
individualist
who
has
chosen
himself
at
all
costs
someone
who
we
grew
up
both
terrified
of
and
wanting
to
become
No
He
is
trying
desperately
to
fit
in
to
use
the
white
supremacist
system
to
his
own
benefit
But
working
for
the
system
always
comes
with
a
price
There
is
a
queer
anxiety
to
Ratcliffe
because
he
knows
his
attempts
to
fit
in
are
pretense
This
is
as
he
says
himself
my
last
chance
for
glory
Does
he
exile
himself
from
the
crew
of
colonizers
because
he
thinks
he
s
better
than
them
or
because
he
thinks
they
ll
see
through
him
Or
both
Captain
John
Smith

with

Ratcliffe
not

Holding

Rugged
masculinity

On
a
certain
level

resents
this
The

Even

the
story
Ratcliffe

with

is
the
heroic

with
Mel

and

reputation

him

John
Smith
one
of
the
colonizers
declares
in
his
introductory
scene
as
Smith
literally
rides
a
cannon
onto
the
ship
Depicted
as
a
natural
leader
he
s
respected
by
his
men
for
his
physical
prowess
and
bravery
that
borders
on
stupidity
Smith
has
a
martyr-like
willingness
to
put
himself
in
harm
s
way
for
his
men
that
while
not
explicitly
labeled
as
Christian
is
certainly
coded
as
such
You
d
do
the
same
for
me
Smith
says
jokingly
to
his
companions
after
leaping
into
the
ocean
during
a
storm
to
save
a
man
who
fell
overboard
He
is
in
essence
exactly
the
kind
of
leading
man
that
Mel
Gibson
the
actor
who
voices
him
spent
a
career
playing
the
mythic
American
cowboy
and
ideal
leading
man
of
Hollywood
cinema
Complete
with
the
domestic
abuse
and
antisemitism
bona
fides
Queer-coded
Ratcliffe
is
trying
to
earn
a
place
in
the
system
by
being
its
most
traditional
guardian
but
he
also
represents
a
kind
of
masculinity
that
has
long
since
gone
indoors
to
the
Royal
Court
concerned
with
accumulation
through
relationship
and
intellect
Americans
recognize
this
as
the
masculinity
of
the
educated
high-born
or
aspirational
cultural
aesthete
anxieties
about
which
would
soon
manifest
in
the
late
‘
90s
and
early
‘
00s
under
the
term
metrosexual
John
Smith
conversely
represents
the
rugged
individualist
masculinity
that
defines
itself
not
by
social
status
but
by
a
cowboy
mentality
by
connection
with
God
family
and
the
land
In
many
ways
Pocahontas
is
structured
like
a
Western
and
John
Smith
may
as
well
be
John
Wayne
John
Smith
saves
the
man
who
fell
overboard
Ratcliffe
is
the
government
lackey
in
a
suit
who
hunkers
down
in
his
cabin
and
only
emerges
once
the
danger
has
passed
clutching
his
pug
while
his
manservant
shields
him
with
an
umbrella
Government
intervention
is
often
a
primary
conflict
in
Westerns
resented
by
white
colonizers
played
by
actors
like
Wayne

have
gone
west
and
figured
out
a
way
to
live
with
varying
levels
of
hostility
to
the
local
Indigenous
community
outside
of
federal
oversight
The
men
in
suits
have
effeminate
mannerisms
a
lot
of
education
and
virtually
no

as
natural
God-given
virility

little

Obvious

but
stay
with
me
In
Ratcliffe
s
villain
anthem
Mine
Mine
Mine
which
is
and
I
can
not
stress
this
enough
a
duet
with
John
Smith
Ratcliffe
is
singing
about
the
gold
allowing
him
to
accumulate
wealth
and
reputation
and
status
delegating
the
digging
to
the
crew
Smith
is
the
one
actually
singing
about
the
land
while
climbing
trees
and
waterfalls
activities
which
seem
unnecessarily
strenuous
But
don
t
they
want
the
same
thing
to
take
whatever
land
they
land
on
in
the
interest
of
colonial
expansion
Haven
t
Smith
and
Ratcliffe
already
been
shown
to
be
very
much
on
the
same
page
about
the
murder
and
displacement
of
Indigenous
peoples
But
Disney
s
edit
would
have
you
think
otherwise
John
Smith
has
swagger
and
a
reputation
that
precedes
him
You
can
t
fight
Indians
without
John
Smith
one
of
the
colonizers
declares
in
his
introductory
scene
as
Smith
literally
rides
a
cannon
onto
the
ship
Beneath
the
surface
anxieties
about
all-too-contemporary
masculinity
and
what
constitutes
manhood
are
relocated
to
the
center
of
the
driving
conflict
of
Pocahontas
one
that
allows
a
corporation
to
elide
reckoning
with
the
violent
historical
subject
matter
of
the
actual
plot
And
therein
is
the
issue
Ratcliffe
becomes
the
villain
because
Smith
his
fellow
colonizer
can
not
be
In
the
end
Ratcliffe
s
men
turn
on
him
At
first
glance
it
might
seem
like
they
are
doing
so
out
of
sympathy
for
Pocahontas
and
her
people
as
Ratcliffe
had
been
trying
to
assassinate
her
father
Chief
Powhatan
But
this
is
not
it
the
other
white
men
don
t
try
to
stop
him
when
he
first
aims
his
gun
not
until
he
accidentally
shoots
John
Smith
who
is
shown
taking
a
bullet
for
the
chief
which
is
please
note
a
fictional
event
that
did
not
happen
You
shot
him

Smith

right
all
along
another

hypocritically
as
all
of
them
had
been
worked
up
in
a
racist

song
Savages

about

the
night
before
The
white
colonizers
mutiny
in
favor
of
the
preferred
masculine
archetype
The
Cowboy
Ratcliffe
is
tied
up
gagged
and
set
to
be
tried
upon
return
to
England
It
is
deeply
satisfying
to
see
the
avowedly
racist
Ratcliffe
in
chains
But
is
the
colonizing
and
racist
rhetoric
what
he
s
being
punished
for
No
The
other
colonizers
are
still
walking
free
many
of
them
staying
behind
to
continue
to
build
up
their
Jamestown
settlement
Colonizing
isn
t
worthy
of
punishment
in
this
film
nor
is
racism
otherwise
every
white
character
John
Smith
included
would
be
in
chains
The
reality
is
that
Ratcliffe
is
punished
for
failing
to
assimilate
within
the
crew
successfully
for
not
embodying
the
right
kind
of
masculinity
for
not
reading
the
room
and
attacking
the
much-respected
cowboy-esque
leader
who
the
men
ultimately
mutiny
for

is
his
crime

How
tenuous
the
conditions
of
acceptance
for
white
gays
doing
the
bidding
of
white
supremacy
Ratcliffe
is
simply
put
a
Corporate
Gay
a
Log
Cabin
Republican
a
Cyrus
Bean
the
Disney
equivalent
of
allegedly
that
one
senator
from
South
Carolina
Ratcliffe
has
bought
into
the
idea
that
serving
the
system
will
benefit
him
and
that
if
only
he
does
its
bidding
things
will
ultimately
work
out
But
queerness
renders
you
automatically
suspect
within
any
system
of
power
even
white
supremacy
What
Ratcliffe
and
other
white
gays
like
him
fail
to
realize
is
that
assimilation
is
not
acceptance
it
is
merely
borrowed
time
There
is
a
savvy
to
the
Queer
Villains
of
Excess
like
Scar
and
Ursula
who
understand
that
there
is
no
utility
in
trying
to
fit
in
who
know
that
there
is
no
box
possibly
small
enough
to
cram
your
queer
ass
into
But
truth
be
told
even
these
villains
have
boundaries
they
won
t
cross
only
ever
wanting
to
kill
the
king
and
usurp
his
throne
but
never
outright
abolish
abusive
systems
of
power
There
is
no
queer
revolution
amongst
Disney
villains
see
There
is
no
abolition
no
truly
radical
liberation
within
the
fairy
tales
that
ultimately
serve
to
codify
what
happily
ever
after
means
and
for
who
In
Disney
queerness
is
only
ever
an
imitation
of
the
hetero
original
never
a
full
expression
of
itself
Gay

are

I
ve
always
loved
how
Teju
Cole
observes
and
moves
through
our
world
a
flâneur
of
modern
life
always
with
a
notebook
or
a
camera
in
hand
Here
we
follow
Cole
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Italy
as
he
chases
the
life
of
Caravaggio
an
artist
and
fugitive
and
murderer
whose
emotionally
charged
often
violent
scenes
and
chiaroscuro
technique
I
studied
closely
in
my
AP
Art
History
class
In
Rome
and
Milan
Cole
revisits
Caravaggio
s
paintings
to
learn
the
truth
about
doom
to
sit
with
unease
and
to
experience
the
artist
s
pain
and
turmoil
I
would
find
in
him
the
reprieve
certain
artists
can
offer
us
in
dark
times
Cole
then
travels
south
to
Naples
and
along
the
coast
of
Sicily
and
later
to
Malta
to
the
places
where
the
painter
spent
his
exile
he
captures
both
the
mundanity
and
intimacy
of
encounters
with
guides
and
strangers
like
his
meeting
in
Syracuse
with
D.
a
young
migrant
who
arrived
by
boat
from
Libya
eight
months
earlier
They
share
a
silent
beautiful
moment
with
The
Burial
of
St
Lucy
Part-travelogue
part-profile
part-art
criticism
and
part-commentary
on
the
ills
and
horrors
of
our
world
it
s
a
stunning
piece
with
masterful
scope
but
also
turns
inward
a
read
you
ll
likely
sit
with
quietly
long
after
you
ve
finished
I
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
two
paintings
set
at
a
right
angle
to
each
other
I
was
awe-struck
out
of
breath
caught
between
these
two
immensities
The
very
act
of
looking
at
an
old
painting
can
be
so
strange
It
is
an
activity
that
is
often
bound
up
with
class
identity
or
social
aspiration
It
can
sometimes
feel
like
a
diverting
or
irritating
stroll
among
white
people
s
ancestors
It
can
also
often
be
wonderful
giving
the
viewer
a
chance
to
be
blessed
by
a
stranger
s
ingenuity
or
insight
But
rarely
something
even
better
happens
A
painting
made
by
someone
in
a
distant
country
hundreds
of
years
ago
an
artist
s
careful
attention
and
turbulent
experience
sedimented
onto
a
stretched
canvas
leaps
out
of
the
past
to
call
you
to
call
you
to
attention
in
the
present
to
drive
you
to
confusion
by
drawing
from
you
both
a
sense
of
alarm
and
a
feeling
of
consolation
to
bring
you
to
an
awareness
of
your
own
self
in
the
act
of
experiencing
something
that
is
well
beyond
the
grasp
of
language
something
that
you
wouldn
t
wish
to
live
without
He
was
a
murderer
a
slaveholder
a
terror
and
a
pest
But
I
don
t
go
to
Caravaggio
to
be
reminded
of
how
good
people
are
and
certainly
not
because
of
how
good
he
was
To
the
contrary
I
seek
him
out
for
a
certain
kind
of
otherwise
unbearable
knowledge
Here
was
an
artist
who
depicted
fruit
in
its
ripeness
and
at
the
moment
it
had
begun
to
rot
an
artist
who
painted
flesh
at
its
most
delicately
seductive
and
most
grievously
injured
When
he
showed
suffering
he
showed
it
so
startlingly
well
because
he
was
on
both
sides
of
it
He
meted
it
out
to
others
and
received
it
in
his
own
body
Caravaggio
is
long
dead
as
are
his
victims
What
remains
is
the
work
and
I
don
t
have
to
love
him
to
know
that
I
need
to
know
what
he
knows
the
knowledge
that
hums
centuries
later
on
the
surface
of
his
paintings
knowledge
of
all
the
pain
loneliness
beauty
fear
and
awful
vulnerability
our
bodies
have
in
common
In
this
essay
published
in
June
amid
a
summer
of
protest
and
global
uprising
poet
and
scholar
Elizabeth
Alexander
writes
about
raising
two
Black
sons
who
are
now
in
their
early
20s
and
how
Black
creativity
and
communal
expression
emerge
in
response
to
the
racism
police
violence
and
trauma
inflicted
on
Black
communities
In
reflections
on
visual
and
musical
artists
like
Kendrick
Lamar
whose
work
is
both
joyful
and
defiant
Alexander
asks
What
does
it
mean
for
a
black
boy
to
fly
to
dream
of
flying
and
transcending
What
does
it
mean
for
a
Black
body
to
dance
to
move
in
protest
and
joy
in
the
face
of
racist
violence
Alexander
s
words
are
urgent
and
powerful
expressing
love
and
rage
and
hope
What
does
it
mean
to
be
able
to
bring
together
the
naturalistic
and
the
visionary
to
imagine
community
as
capable
of
reanimating
even
its
most
hopeless
and
anesthetized
members
What
does
it
mean
for
a
presumably
murdered
black
body
to
come
to
life
in
his
community
in
a
dance
idiom
that
is
uniquely
part
of
black
culture
and
youth
culture
all
of
that
power
channelled
into
a
lifting
A
sibling
to
Joseph
s
work
is
Hiro
Murai
s
video
for
Flying
Lotus
s
Never
Catch
Me
It
opens
at
a
funeral
for
two
children
a
black
boy
and
girl
who
lie
heartbreak-beautiful
in
their
open
caskets
Their
community
grieves
inconsolably
in
the
church
The
scene
is
one
of
profound
mourning
And
then
the
children
open
their
eyes
and
climb
out
of
their
caskets
They
dance
explosively
in
front
of
the
pulpit
before
running
down
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
church
The
mourners
can
not
see
this
resurrection
for
it
is
a
fantasia
The
kids
dance
another
dance
of
black
L.
A.
the
force
of
black
bodily
creativity
that
expressive
life
source
born
of
violence
and
violation
that
have
upturned
the
world
for
generations
The
resurrected
babies
dance
with
a
pumping
force
But
the
community
s
grief
is
unmitigated
because
once
again
this
is
a
dreamscape
The
children
spring
out
into
the
light
and
climb
into
a
car—no
it
is
a
hearse—and
smiling
with
the
joy
of
mischievous
escapees
drive
away
Kids

In
this
intriguing
tale
Leah
Sottile
brings
to
life
a
17th-century
shipwreck
and
an
intensely
curious
treasure
hunter
who
devotes
years
and
years
to
uncovering
its
history
In
1694
a
Manila
galleon
the
Santo
Cristo
de
Burgos
wrecked
off
the
coast
of
Oregon
near
the
foot
of
Neahkahnie
mountain
For
more
than
150
years
treasure
seekers
have
searched
and
dug
for
lost
treasures
from
this
galleon
said
to
transport
valuable
cargo
and
exotic
goods
across
the
Pacific
from
the
Philippines
to
Mexico
For
generations
many
Oregonians
had
indulged
that
Goonie
side
of
themselves
allowing
every
single
bit
of
wax
and
porcelain
to
restart
the
song
of
buried
riches
writes
Sottile
While
the
idea
of
treasure
is
tantalizing
Sottile
turns
to
another
mystery
Who
were
the
men
on
this
ship
Who
was
their
captain
Her
questions
lead
her
to
Cameron
La
Follette
whose
extensive
research
and
work
with
faraway
academics
and
archivists
patch
together
the
legendary
galleon
s
voyage
and
demise
LaFollette
s
deep
respect
for
the
forgotten
people
on
the
Santo
Cristo
sets
her
apart
from
others
obsessed
with
it
while
Sottile
s
careful
portrait
of
LaFollette
as
a
person
driven
by
a
sense
of
humanity
makes
for
a
beautifully
weaved
story
of
quirky
history
Every
time
González
got
back
to
her
La
Follette
had
new
questions
They
went
back
and
forth
like
this
for
a
few
years—new
requests
new
reports
new
reports
new
requests
Between
2015
and
2017
La
Follette
spent
more
than
$
10,000
of
her
own
money
paying
González
other
archivists
and
translators
in
Spain
Mexico
City
and
Manila
I
couldn
t
get
a
new
garage
door
I
couldn
t
get
glasses
that
actually
worked
very
well
La
Follette
said
I
was
looking
at
things
blurry
in
the
distance
and
was
like
I
really
got
ta
get
glasses
but
it
s
gon
na
cost
$
800
and
I
have
to
pay
Esther
s
bill
Just
like
Ed
Fire
La
Follette
couldn
t
rest
until
she
reached
the
bottom
of
her
curiosity
Eventually
González
unearthed
a
partial
cargo
manifest
buried
deep
in
the
archives
the
best
evidence
yet
that
the
Santo
Cristo
had
in
fact
been
packed
with
treasure
fine
bedsheets
embroidered
with
flowers
ivory
sculptures
of
the
infant
Christ
and
saints
that
would
be
placed
in
New
World
churches
gold
paper
fans
delicate
lace
And
wax
for
candles
TikTok
s
mission
is
to
inspire
creativity
and
bring
joy
and
in
the
beginning
for
many
people
it
was
all
about
fun
But
Black
creators
on
the
app
like
musician
Brianna
Blackmon
have
reported
instances
of
racism
harassment
and
censorship
Jason
Parham
digs
around
talks
to
nearly
30
Black
creators
and
learns
that
these
problems
run
deep
Blackness
is
a
proven
attention
getter
writes
Parham
Its
adoption
is
racism
custom-fit
In
this
incisive
thought-provoking
piece
Parham
examines
a
disturbing
form
of
content
production
on
the
platform
that
suggests
a
twisted
love
of
Black
culture
through
caricature
posted
primarily
by
young
white
women
and
white
gay
men
The
fundamental
elements
of
TikTok
the
borrowing
remixing
and
repackaging
of
content
as
one
s
own
make
it
easy
to
blur
the
lines
between
flattery
and
mockery
and
theft
Is
this
content
a
new
kind
of
collaborative
performance
art
or
modern
minstrelsy
It
s
a
fascinating
read
for
understanding
the
dynamic
often
strange
content
community
on
TikTok
the
culture
of
Generation
Z
and
the
appropriation
of
Black
expression
Wearing
a
mask
has
long
been
part
of
the
social
internet
The
web
has
operated
like
a
Party
City
costume
shop
since
dotcom-era
chat
rooms
made
cool
the
idea
of
inhabiting
made-up
identities
and
hiding
behind
usernames
These
personas
could
be
intensely
liberating
allowing
people
to
explore
hidden
ideas
or
sexualities
or
simply
enjoy
a
carnivalesque
permissiveness
to
say
or
do
something
outrageous
It
s
all
just
a
joke
For
clout
For
show
But
the
mask
of
Blackness
can
not
be
worn
without
consequences
It
can
t
be
worn
as
a
joke
without
reaching
into
some
deep
cultural
and
historical
ugliness
without
opening
a
wound
of
abuse
and
humiliation
What
sours
this
creative
repackaging
mutates
the
joy
into
hatefulness
is
when
the
content
is
estranged
from
its
original
context
The
way
someone
or
something
can
so
quickly
and
easily
be
warped
diluted
recast
as
something
other
The
way
one
s
culture
can
be
stolen
and
made
monstrous
made
meaningless
TikTok
all
but
eradicates
traditional
norms
about
cultural
ownership
the
critic
Jon
Caramanica
has
written
If
you
spend
a
long
enough
time
on
the
app
as
I
did
over
the
past
few
months
in
lockdown
reporting
this
story
you
begin
to
see
it
as
a
prism
through
which
to
better
understand
yourself
and
the
world
around
you—what
draws
you
in
what
makes
you
laugh
what
repels
you
There
were
moments
when
scrolling
through
TikTok
I
began
to
look
upon
myself
not
as
I
am
but
as
blurred
projections
of
a
fractured
self
What
constitutes
a
real
partnership
Why
are
marriages
and
other
monogamous
romantic
relationships
still
generally
viewed
as
the
nucleus
of
one
s
life
Rhaina
Cohen
examines
friendships
throughout
history
from
the
intimate
same-sex
friendships
of
the
18th
to
early
20th
centuries
to
today
s
platonic
partnerships
We
re
introduced
to
Kami
West
and
Kate
Tillotson
two
women
who
bonded
in
Marine
Corps
boot
camp
and
have
since
built
a
deep
and
complex
friendship
one
that
involves
child
care
and
emotional
and
social
support
There
s
also
John
Carroll
and
Joe
Rivera
platonic
partners
who
met
at
a
gay
bar
who
have
similarly
broken
free
from
the
confines
of
traditional
thinking
The
idea
here
is
that
it
s
impossible
to
expect
a
single
person
to
satisfy
all
of
one
s
needs
and
the
people
Cohen
describes
have
custom-designed
partnerships
that
work
for
them
They
can
be
models
for
how
we
as
a
society
might
expand
our
conceptions
of
intimacy
and
care
especially
now
in
a
pandemic
that
has
forced
us
to
reimagine
our
lives
and
support
networks
People
expect
to
pile
emotional
support
sexual
satisfaction
shared
hobbies
intellectual
stimulation
and
harmonious
co-parenting
all
into
the
same
cart
Carroll
52
thinks
this
is
an
impossible
ask
experts
share
his
concern
When
we
channel
all
our
intimate
needs
into
one
person
the
psychotherapist
Esther
Perel
writes
we
actually
stand
to
make
the
relationship
more
vulnerable
In
many
ways
Americans
are
already
redefining
what
loving
and
living
can
look
like
Just
in
the
past
several
months
experts
and
public
intellectuals
from
disparate
ideological
persuasions
have
encouraged
heterosexual
couples
to
look
to
the
queer
and
immigrant
communities
for
healthy
models
of
marriage
and
family
The
coronavirus
pandemic
by
underscoring
human
vulnerability
and
interdependence
has
inspired
people
to
imagine
networks
of
care
beyond
the
nuclear
family
Polyamory
and
asexuality
both
of
which
push
back
against
the
notion
that
a
monogamous
sexual
relationship
is
the
key
to
a
fulfilling
adult
life
are
rapidly
gaining
visibility
Expanding
the
possible
roles
that
friends
can
play
in
one
another
s
lives
could
be
the
next
frontier
Willy
Staley
s
razor-sharp
critique
explores
television
s
depiction
of
New
York
City
these
days
commenting
specifically
on
High
Maintenance
Master
of
None
and
Russian
Doll
While
critics
have
praised
High
Maintenance
for
its
accurate
representation
of
the
city
Staley
writes
that
its
reality
as
well
as
the
worlds
in
the
other
two
Netflix
shows
ignore
economic
inequalities
and
class
differences
between
characters
Instead
New
York
City
on
screen
is
an
idealized
composite
of
the
experiences
of
young
creative-class
New
Yorkers
and
Brooklyn
transplants
a
fantasyland
where
strangers
from
all
walks
of
life
connect
It
s
no
longer
a
melting
pot
writes
Staley
but
some
kind
of
hot
tub
On
High
Maintenance
The
show
is
brilliant
at
sending
up
the
anxieties
and
pathologies
of
the
city
s
yuppies
but
characters
outside
this
circle
are
often
made
relatable
to
HBO
s
audience
by
being
supplied
with
some
quirk
hidden
talent
or
non­-normative
sexuality
In
this
way
the
show
depends
on
its
audience
s
prejudices
in
order
to
undercut
them
On
Russian
Doll
The
actual
transactional
quasi
friendships
that
New
Yorkers
have
with
their
bodega
guys
are
plenty
interesting
Like
a
priest
a
bodega
guy
gets
to
know
the
shameful
weaknesses
of
his
regulars
who
must
assume
on
some
level
that
he
s
not
secretly
writing
their
stories
in
his
own
head
His
perspective
would
be
an
interesting
one
to
get
to
know
but
in
Russian
Doll
what
s
curious
about
this
relationship
is
rendered
null
with
a
couple
of
lines
of
dialogue
In
trying
to
counteract
harmful
stereotypes
the
show
has
succeeded
in
doing
something
altogether
stranger
erasing
diversity
through
the
act
of
depicting
it
By
making
Farran
an
aspirant
to
the
same
sort
of
success
the
show
s
writers
value
by
making
him
a
guy
who
thinks
working
at
a
cannery
is
inherently
absurd
something
you
d
put
in
a
novel
Russian
Doll
suggests
that
everyone
in
this
city
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
ultimately
the
same
sharing
identical
aesthetic
and
professional
aspirations
and
we
d
know
that
if
we
only
paid
closer
attention
Kevin
Powell
s
unconventional
profile
of
Def
Jam
Recordings
co-founder
Russell
Simmons
the
godfather
of
hip-hop
is
also
a
deep
introspection
on
being
a
Black
man
in
America
power
in
the
time
of
#
MeToo
and
the
culture
of
misogyny
and
violence
in
the
music
industry
I
struggled
mightily
through
the
1990s
through
the
heyday
of
my
years
at
Vibe
as
I
participated
in
a
culture
that
I
knew
was
loaded
with
disgusting
examples
of
manhood
writes
Powell
To
date
20
women
have
come
forward
to
accuse
Simmons
of
sexual
assault
including
rape
since
2018
he
has
reportedly
lived
in
Bali
to
protect
himself
from
prosecution
as
Indonesia
has
no
extradition
treaty
with
the
U.
S
Powell
also
examines
Oprah
Winfrey
s
withdrawal
as
executive
producer
from
the
On
the
Record
documentary
about
Simmons
ultimately
distancing
herself
from
the
Black
women
who
have
accused
him
HBO
has
purchased
On
The
Record
post-Sundance
and
you
will
have
to
decide
for
yourself
what
all
this
is
was
and
could
be
But
if
you
watch
this
film
the
way
I
watched
it
you
wonder
how
and
why
Oprah
Winfrey
would
walk
away
searching
for
the
real
reason
and
how
and
why
she
could
separate
herself
from
these
Black
women
and
this
film
which
is
like
separating
herself
from
herself
Only
Oprah
knows
the
whole
truth
and
perhaps
Russell
Simmons
godfather
of
hip-hop
does
too—
And
honestly
this
has
been
the
most
difficult
piece
I
have
ever
written
in
my
life
My
emotions
are
bleeding
I
have
had
painfully
sleepless
nights
as
this
story
has
dragged
on
and
on
and
on
As
a
Black
man
I
do
not
ever
want
to
see
another
Black
man
go
down
in
a
world
already
seemingly
designed
for
us
to
fall
But
by
the
same
token
I
do
not
want
to
see
Black
women—or
any
women
of
any
background—sacrificed
just
to
spare
a
Black
man—or
any
man
of
any
background—accused
of
wrongdoing
This
hurts
me
from
all
sides
every
part
of
it
I
have
been
a
combination
of
angry
and
sad
because
of
the
very
real
and
very
vivid
stories
of
the
many
women
who
ve
come
forth
and
because
Russell
Simmons
had
been
a
hero
of
mine
a
hero
for
many
of
us
boys
in
the
‘
hood
When
he
made
it
we
made
it
When
he
dreamed
big
we
dreamed
big
He
was
us
and
we
were
him
I
could
not
have
imagined
these
kinds
of
allegations
against
him
when
I
first
saw
him
in
person
at
some
New
York
City
event
in
the
early
1990s
when
I
just
stared
because
there
he
was
and
I
was
too
timid
to
greet
him
I
just
stared
hoping
whatever
magic
he
had
rubbed
off
on
me
a
poor
boy
from
the
ghetto
Nor
could
I
have
imagined
all
these
years
later
that
he
would
be
a
fallen
hero
desperately
trying
to
prove
his
innocence
thanking
me
just
for
listening
to
him
me
the
writer
who
had
found
his
voice
long
ago
because
of
the
culture—our
culture—Russell
Simmons
helped
to
bring
to
the
entire
world
Was
2020
really
the
year
of
the
female
superhero
Looking
back
on
films
like
Catwoman
Elektra
and
Captain
Marvel
and
considering
this
year
s
movies
like
Birds
of
Prey
the
soon-to-be-released
Wonder
Woman
1984
and
the
upcoming
Black
Widow
on
the
surface
you
d
think
Hollywood
finally
gets
it
But
Soraya
Roberts
argues
that
today
s
female
superheroes
still
operate
within
a
world
ruled
by
white
men
Having
spoken
in
May
to
the
original
Supergirl
herself
Helen
Slater
who
starred
in
the
1984
film
Roberts
explores
the
legacy
of
female
superhero
films
and
asks
what
has
changed
in
the
past
30+
years
and
what
has
unfortunately
stayed
the
same
Catwoman
paws
at
feminism—
Catwomen
are
not
contained
by
the
rules
of

Berry
s
character
says—but
this
soft-core
fantasy
is
still
bound
by
the
limits
of
the
male
imagination
The
film
is
very
much
an
expression
of
a
popular
brand
of
feminism
from
the
early
aughts
just
as
Elektra
would

Old-growth
forests
in
North
America
are
like
something
out
of
a
fairytale
huge
trees
luminescent
with
moss
with
boughs
arching
above
your
head
and
gnarled
roots
beneath
your
feet
dicing
in
and
out
of
the
soil
like
sea
serpents
And
as
Ferris
Jabr
discovers
in
this
story
the
magic
of
these
trees
goes
beyond
what
we
see
with
intricate
fungal
networks
weaving
them
together
into
an
inclusive
community
that
links
nearly
every
tree
in
a
forest
even
trees
of
different
species
This
is
a
fascinating
piece
that
shows
you
these
giant
sentinels
are
more
than
you
expect
more
than
just
individuals
Jabr
goes
into
the
forest
with
Suzanne
Simard
a
professor
of
forest
ecology
at
the
University
of
British
Columbia
who
has
studied
these
systems
and
proved
a
dynamic
exchange
of
resources
through
mycorrhizal
networks
between
the
two
species
of
paper
birch
and
Douglas
fir
Her
work
has
provoked
a
certain
amount
of
controversy
Since
Darwin
biologists
have
emphasized
the
perspective
of
the
individual
…
the
single-minded
ambitions
of
selfish
genes
Simard
is
proving
this
is
not
what
is
happening
in
old-growth
forests
they
are
neither
an
assemblage
of
stoic
organisms
tolerating
one
another
s
presence
nor
a
merciless
battle
royale
It
s
a
vast
ancient
and
intricate
society
And
trees
are
not
just
interacting
with
each
other
trees
sense
nearby
plants
and
animals
and
alter
their
behavior
accordingly
The
gnashing
mandibles
of
an
insect
might
prompt
the
production
of
chemical
defenses
…
Some
studies
have
even
suggested
that
plant
roots
grow
toward
the
sound
of
running
water
A
forest
operating
as
a
complicated
sharing
society
is
a
powerful
notion
Not
only
does
it
garner
more
respect
for
this
ecosystem
but
it
could
prove
that
cooperation
is
as
central
to
evolution
as
competition
Wherever
living
things
emerge
they
find
one
another
mingle
and
meld
Last
winter
Sarah
Gilman
saw
a
cougar
near
her
home
in
Washington
s
North
Cascades
…
the
cougar
dropped
to
a
crouch
a
few
paces
from
me
It
was
still
woolly
with
kittenhood
but
big
enough
to
send
a
chill
down
my
spine
She
poetically
describes
the
eeriness
of
knowing
that
an
apex
predator
lives
in
her
area
the
feeling
of
being
watched
the
sense
of
vertigo
disoriented
by
these
fleeting
brushes
with
a
creature
of
foreign
compass
Fascinated
as
much
as
fearful
Gilman
joins
Lauren
Satterfield
a
cougar
researcher
who
comes
to
track
her
local
cougars
bringing
science
into
Gilman
s
personal
realm
Aided
by
a
houndsman
they
began
a
search
an
important
one
as
chaotic
as
it
looked
from
behind
four
retreating
dog
butts
studies
like
Satterfield
s
have
revealed
patterns
in
cougars
lives
A
lack
of
knowledge
leads
to
exaggeration
and
cougars
have
acquired
a
reputation
for
danger
they
do
not
deserve
They
avoid
humans
as
much
as
possible
and
favor
wild
prey
over
easier-to-catch
domestic
animals
but
perception
still
outweighs
science
on
so
many
fronts
In
California
complaints
resulting
in
permits
to
kill
cougars
climbed
steadily
with
human
population
growth
…
Then
after
cougars
killed
two
people
in
1994
they
ballooned
…
less
to
a
rise
in
cougar
activity
than
to
hyper-vigilance
stoked
by
fear
Science
has
slowly
drawn
this
mysterious
animal
out
of
the
shadows
and
into
focus
not
dispelling
all
irrational
fear
but
helping
In
Washington
after
years
of
study
sport
hunt
was
restructured
to
preserve
cougar
social
structures
Protecting
them
is
significant
as
cougars
build
worlds
with
cougar-killed
carcasses
being
shown
to
sustain
39
species
of
scavenging
mammals
and
birds
and
215
species
of
beetle
This
is
something
Gilman
sees
for
herself
when
they
find
a
cougar
kill
surrounded
by
tracks
in
blood
and
shadow
magpie
raven
eagle
the
traceries
of
wingtips
brushing
the
drifts
a
roil
of
life
pouring
in
after
the
cat
s
kill
shown
clear
on
the
canvas
of
winter
This
is
a
beautiful
piece
enhanced
with
wonderful
drawings
Gilman
has
done
herself
and
in
the
end
her
fear
is
replaced
by
reverence
as
although
still
uncomfortable
to
be
walking
the
same
land
as
a
cougar
she
is
also
aware
it
is
a
gift
Shipwrecks
have
always
held
a
fascination
in
the
human
psyche
the
mystery
of
the
seabed
where
ghostly
hulls
of
twisted
metal
and
weathered
blackened
wood
lie
is
intriguing
precisely
because
that
s
what
it
is
a
mystery
Enter
Ben
an
autonomous
boat
who
is
learning
to
map
sea
floors
an
area
we
know
comparatively
little
about
with
estimates
that
we
ve
mapped
just
9
percent
of
the
world
s
oceans
to
modern
standards
Ben
is
short
for
Bathymetric
Explorer
and
Navigator
but
the
way
Matthew
Braga
describes
the
boat
he
is
definitely
a
Ben
infused
with
a
real
sense
of
personality
a
little
engine
that
could
an
intrepid
explorer
that
goes
where
humans
can
not
Ben
is
a
bright
banana
yellow
and
an
ambitious
little
boat
with
its
own
challenges
to
overcome
and
opportunities
to
seize
This
little
boat
still
has
a
lot
to
learn
and
is
training
in
a
stretch
of
water
called
Thunder
Bay
off
Michigan
s
northeastern
coast
Braga
joins
one
of
the
sessions
where
Ben
is
learning
to
mow
the
lawn
what
oceanographers
call
the
slow
tedious
craft
of
making
maps
at
sea
Braga
s
accessible
description
of
Ben
trundling
back
and
forth
learning
to
understand
and
respond
to
the
world
around
it
is
reminiscent
of
a
Roomba
robot
vacuum
learning
to
clean
the
house
without
knocking
over
the
cat
bowl
But
Ben
has
more
to
offer
than
a
dust-free
carpet
autonomous
boats
like
Ben
could
gather
an
unprecedented
amount
of
data
data
crucial
to
our
understanding
of
climate
change
and
the
effects
it
has
had
on
everything
from
melting
Arctic
ice
to
undersea
life
The
data
that
Braga
sees
sliding
into
view
like
a
side-scrolling
video
game
is
the
start
of
Ben
s
contribution
to
answering
such
life-defining
questions
On
a
smaller
scale
Ben
can
also
turn
detective
trying
to
solve
decades-old
mysteries
such
as
the
crash
site
of
the
long-lost
plane
of
storied
pilot
Amelia
Earhart
Ben
has
already
been
sent
to
investigate
although
is
yet
to
find
the
answer
This
is
not
the
first
autonomous
boat
and
certainly
won
t
be
that
last
so
Braga
s
exploration
of
this
technology
offers
a
clear
insight
into
a
scientific
development
that
in
the
not
so
distant
future
will
change
our
knowledge
of
the
seas
This
story
continues
the
theme
of
maps
but
on
a
much
much
bigger
scale
Shannon
Stirone
s
passion
for
the
subject
is
apparent
as
with
a
tone
of
reverence
she
discusses
a
project
to
make
the
most
detailed
3D
map
of
the
universe
The
sense
of
perspective
this
piece
provides
is
daunting
…
you
and
I
are
going
about
our
days
on
an
average
rocky
planet
in
just
one
of
trillions
of
solar
systems
but
rather
than
just
making
you
feel
small
Stirone
provides
a
sense
of
wonder
at
what
we
are
a
part
of
For
as
long
as
we
have
existed
humans
have
been
trying
to
understand
themselves
in
the
context
of
physical
location
One
of
the
oldest
maps
in
the
world
shows
us
that
the
ancient
Babylonians
were
trying
to
place
themselves
and
their
location
into
the
greater
unknown
regions
beyond
their
understanding
Why
do
we
crave
to
see
beyond
our
boundaries
learn
about
what
we
do
not
understand
Perhaps
this
thirst
for
knowledge
is
the
very
essence
of
what
makes
us
human
Stirone
argues
To
know
where
you
are
at
any
given
time
is
a
frame
of
reference
in
which
to
measure
your
life
We
are
doing
pretty
well
in
this
quest
We
know
the
Earth
is
about
4
billion
years
old
we
know
that
13
8
billion
years
ago
there
was
nothing
and
then
there
was
everything
But
there
is
still
a
lot
we
don
t
know
and
at
the
heart
of
that
is
dark
energy
Called
dark
because
scientists
simply
can
not
see
it
and
they
don
t
really
have
any
idea
what
it
is
it
is
the
dominating
force
in
the
universe
which
accounts
for
70
percent
of
everything
in
existence
and
is
responsible
for
expanding
our
universe
outward
at
speeds
of
tens
of
thousands
of
miles
per
second
Stirone
visits
the
team
at
Kitt
Peak
National
Observatory
studying
dark
energy
using
DESI
the
Dark
Energy
Spectroscopic
Instrument
The
science
is
complex
but
she
manages
to
disseminate
the
difficult
concepts
explaining
how
this
team
is
looking
back
in
time
at
ancient
light
to
better
understand
the
story
of
the
universe
The
fact
that
this
science
is
in
fact
history
is
somewhat
mind-boggling
the
images
we
see
of
space
are
never
from
the
present
––
that
light
has
taken
billions
or
millions
of
years
to
reach
us
and
DESI
is
making
a
map
of
a
universe
that
is
constantly
changing
forever
expanding
So
what
is
the
point
of
making
a
map
that
is
out
of
date
Stirone
explains
that
in
order
to
know
where
we
are
going
we
must
first
know
where
we
have
been
and
for
humans
it
is
all
about
knowing
There
is
a
particularly
striking
image
in
this
piece
an
alligator
that
Will
Wellman
spots
in
a
drainage
ditch
by
a
Florida
gas
station
surrounded
by
trash
food
wrappers
beer
cans
plastic
bags
It
is
a
visual
representation
of
the
plight
of
Florida
wildlife
Traveling
as
a
child
Wellman
was
asked
about
his
Florida
home
Is
it
just
a
big
swamp
down
there
Are
there
alligators
in
your
backyard
Now
the
questions
have
changed
Is
it
just
a
bunch
of
snowbirds
down
there
Are
there
golf
courses
everywhere
Seemingly
innocuous
these
questions
are
poignant
for
Wellman
demonstrating
the
changes
that
Florida
has
gone
through
and
is
still
going
through
from
wild
green
to
lifeless
gray
as
every
day
1,000
new
people
move
to
the
state
and
each
hour
12
acres
of
land
is
developed
Wellman
s
sadness
at
what
is
happening
to
his
home
state
is
palpable
and
his
language
hums
with
empathy
for
the
creatures
caught
up
in
these
changes
His
writing
also
has
an
air
of
hopelessness
but
Wellman
is
prepared
to
be
convinced
that
something
can
be
done
by
the
team
he
is
joining
on
a
swamp
expedition
the
Florida
Wildlife
Corridor
team
Their
aim
is
to
prove
that
it
isn
t
too
late
to
protect
a
continuous
stretch
of
natural
land
throughout
the
state
What
the
animals
have
to
deal
with
daily
is
insufficient
connectivity
with
one
of
the
leading
causes
of
death
for
the
endangered
Florida
panther
being
collision
with
vehicles
The
team
is
joined
by
a
documentary
crew
something
Wellman
does
not
seem
particularly
comfortable
with
especially
when
some
crew
step
over
a
cottonmouth
this
one
more
than
double
the
size
of
the
last
earning
gasps
from
these
seasoned
explorers
but
he
accepts
that
without
the
social
media
and
documentaries
folks
wouldn
t
know
about
fractured
landscapes
and
the
value
of
wildlife
corridors
in
Florida
Despite
the
filming
there
is
still
excitement
going
into
the
swamps
where
Wellman
feels
the
most
alive
…
a
sense
of
life
fed
by
ever-present
danger
Swamps
are
marked
by
death
all
the
rotting
organic
matter
that
mars
its
floor
and
gives
it
life
and
by
risk
every
nook
and
cranny
could
hide
snakes
gators
and
more
But
then
in
the
middle
of
a
dense
swamp
the
team
hears
a
loudspeaker
from
Lowes
reminding
them
that
the
wild-urban
interface
is
razor-thin
and
if
nothing
is
done
all
that
will
be
left
is
alligators
living
in
trash

This
is
a
story
that
puts
you
through
a
whole
gamut
of
emotion
from
frustration
admiration
joy
to
sadness
all
while
discussing
fried
rice
on
a
bagel
The
protagonist
behind
the
bagel
is
Michael
Thompson
an
inmate
of
Muskegon
Correctional
Facility
in
Michigan
who
has
served
25
years
of
a
40-
to
60-year
sentence
for
selling
marijuana
in
Michigan
a
state
where
cannabis
is
now
legal
But
it
is
not
his
own
plight
that
is
concerning
Thompson
he
has
been
moved
by
the
story
of
a
Black
man
killed
by
a
Minneapolis
police
officer
George
Floyd
Wanting
to
find
a
way
to
mark
Floyd
s
death
Thompson
decided
to
share
a
special
meal
with
his
inmates
in
a
celebration
honoring
Floyd
s
life
Such
a
simple
concept
is
a
monumental
task
in
prison
and
you
feel
great
pride
in
the
inmates
you
are
joining
on
this
mission
First
there
is
the
issue
of
money
Thompson
wanted
to
feed
the
whole
unit
but
resources
meant
it
had
to
be
capped
at
50
inmates
Some
food
was
donated
and
the
rest
Thompson
bought
from
the
commissary
Then
there
were
tools
the
entire
operation
had
to
be
carried
out
using
only
flimsy
plastic
knives
a
single
microwave
and
empty
popcorn
bags
The
men
struggled
tearing
their
hands
up
with
plastic
while
cutting
but
at
the
end
each
attendee
was
served
one
celebration
bagel
a
bag
of
chips
and
a
soda
And
that
food
was
so
appreciated
for
some
the
first
cold
pop
they
had
drunk
for
decades
More
than
just
the
enjoyment
of
the
food
this
meal
brought
the
men
together
even
though
they
had
to
eat
separately
because
After
they
returned
to
their
cells
each
man
sat
in
silence
for
8
minutes
and
46
seconds
And
then
they
began
to
eat
As
a
food
writer
Corey
Mintz
loves
a
supermarket
more
than
most
in
fact
he
got
married
in
one
between
the
cash
register
the
root-vegetable
table
a
group
of
…
friends
and
family
and
a
display
of
maple
syrup
In
this
piece
he
gives
us
a
fascinating
history
of
the
supermarket
whilst
bemoaning
what
is
unwittingly
being
lost
by
more
and
more
people
as
they
choose
to
order
their
groceries
online
Written
just
before
COVID-19
hit
in
full
force
the
topic
is
eerily
prophetic
of
things
to
come
When
Mintz
discusses
the
loss
of
getting
out
of
the
house
the
freedom
of
choice
being
in
a
large
expansive
space
the
visual
stimulation
of
all
that
abundance
on
the
shelves
he
was
unaware
that
the
arrival
of
the
pandemic
was
soon
to
rush
this
reality
to
the
fore
for
millions
However
as
mental
health
deteriorates
alongside
isolation
in
2020
the
accuracy
of
some
of
Mintz
s
other
points
is
undeniable
The
idea
that
interactions
with
local
storeowners
or
weak
ties
improve
physical
and
mental
health
and
…
reduces
loneliness
This
year
supermarkets
have
been
bombarded
by
a
new
wave
of
online
customers
and
the
herculean
feat
it
takes
to
get
a
delivery
slot
suggests
that
the
figures
in
this
article
that
1
5
­percent
of
people
in
Canada
and
3
percent
in
the
U.
S
order
their
food
online
are
already
out
of
date
Now
that
people
have
discovered
the
delight
of
bananas
and
chocolate
biscuits
turning
up
at
their
door
will
they
ever
go
back
to
their
local
supermarkets
If
these
community
interactions
are
lost
on
a
permanent
basis
what
is
the
long-term
cost
Mintz
will
certainly
be
hoping
that
in
the
future
we
remember
that
while
other
human
beings
can
be
annoying—clipping
our
nails
on
the
subway
calling
instead
of
texting
disrespecting
the
unwritten
rule
that
the
middle
seat
on
a
plane
gets
armrest
preference—we
need
one
another
This
essay
resonates
with
the
pure
joy
that
a
particular
food
can
bring
but
it
s
not
the
most
obvious
of
foods
a
bitter
citrus
fruit
boiled
in
sugar
to
create
a
breakfast
condiment
…
a.
k.
a
marmalade
Potts
language
draws
you
into
the
kitchen
with
her
as
she
brews
up
her
concoctions
so
you
can
almost
feel
the
steam
and
stickiness
as
she
drops
saffron
strands
into
a
couple
of
the
jars
stirring
last
minute
and
they
hang
suspended
in
the
jelly
perfect
threads
The
pleasure
she
derives
from
her
potted
sunshine
is
apparent
but
more
fascinating
is
the
complicated
world
of
marmalade
that
she
explores
A
central
theme
of
British
culture
eaten
by
Samuel
Pepys
James
Bond
and
Paddington
Bear
it
inspires
fanaticism
Invited
to
judge
at
the
World
s
Original
Marmalade
Awards
Potts
discovers
that
the
tricky
maddening
nature
of
marmalade
is
precisely
why
people
love
making
it
Along
with
Potts
we
brace
ourselves
for
the
marmalade
obsessives
she
would
find
while
judging
for
four
days
at
Dalemain
And
yes
50
sheep
were
dyed
orange
in
readiness
for
this
year
s
festival
but
despite
herself
Potts
finds
herself
entranced
by
this
eccentric
world
and
when
she
is
the
first
to
try
the
marmalade
that
ultimately
won
the
Double
Gold
International
Marmalade
award
in
the
artisan
category
she
wanted
to
ring
everyone
I
know
and
tell
them
about
this
stuff
It
turns
out
the
subculture
of
marmalade
is
rather
delightful
Once
back
at
home
and
in
a
global
lockdown
Potts
finds
comfort
in
making
her
own
marmalade
there
is
something
inherently
optimistic
about
preservation
about
putting
something
away
for
your
future
Read
this
loving
homage
to
marmalade
and
you
too
will
find
a
small
optimism
a
hope
of
orange-colored
happiness
in
your
future
In
this
essay
Marie
Mutsuki
Mockett
evokes
the
vivid
associations
we
can
have
with
food
She
argues
that
the
food
of
our
youth
given
to
us
by
our
mothers
formulates
our
palette
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
As
a
teenager
in
the
hospital
with
pneumonia
Mockett
craved
Japanese
soul
food
her
mother
brought
her
pickled
sour
plums
rice
and
seasoned
ground
beef
and
her
body
reconstituted
itself
out
of
her
nourishment
Even
today
when
she
is
sick
she
yearns
for
those
flavors
Now
the
tables
have
turned
and
with
her
mother
aging
it
is
Mockett
who
is
bringing
meals
that
bring
her
comfort
such
as
elegant
flats
of
sushi
with
the
spinach
…
steamed
the
water
squeezed
out
and
the
leaves
placed
into
strips
Despite
her
mother
leaving
Japan
for
the
United
States
decades
earlier
it
is
the
food
she
grew
up
with
and
taught
her
daughter
to
love
that
they
share
their
personal
and
regional
history
interwoven
COVID-19
has
now
robbed
Mockett
of
the
chance
to
share
meals
with
her
mother
whose
nursing
home
was
one
of
the
first
to
shut
its
doors
to
visitors
She
manages
to
express
her
devastation
with
a
simple
yet
searing
description
Sometimes
I
get
a
photo
of
her
eating
her
meals
There
is
no
sushi
on
her
plate
This
year
has
been
a
struggle
for
many
small
restaurants
with
so
many
having
to
shut
their
doors
In
this
piece
Gabrielle
Hamilton
tells
the
story
of
the
closure
hers
Prune
but
it
is
the
tale
of
many
Written
from
a
first-person
perspective
this
is
a
deeply
personal
essay
that
exposes
the
pain
of
shuttering
a
lifelong
dream
Prune
was
20
years
old
when
the
gates
were
finally
rolled
down
A
bistro
in
Manhattan
s
East
Village
when
it
was
born
there
was
no
Eater
no
Instagram
no
hipster
Brooklyn
food
scene
Hamilton
worked
seven
nights
a
week
driven
by
the
sensory
the
human
the
poetic
and
the
profane
not
by
money
or
a
thirst
to
expand
However
once
she
cut
her
first
payroll
check
she
understood
that
poetic
notion
aside
she
was
running
a
business
When
COVID-19
hit
there
was
one
piece
of
unemotional
data
to
work
with
the
checking
account
balance
and
there
was
not
enough
in
it
It
took
a
week
to
shut
the
restaurant
A
week
of
cleaning
and
burying
par-cooked
chickens
under
a
tight
seal
of
duck
fat
to
see
if
we
could
keep
them
perfectly
preserved
in
their
airtight
coffins
Then
followed
weeks
of
paperwork
desperately
applying
for
grants
and
unemployment
that
failed
to
appear
Then
further
weeks
of
idleness
and
quarantine
and
the
realization
that
although
there
was
still
a
month
of
food
in
the
freezer
what
about
somehow
getting
hurt
and
needing
serious
medical
care
with
no
insurance
More
questions
followed
Is
Prune
necessary
Will
restaurants
survive
the
pandemic
Having
decided
against
delivery
and
going
online
sticking
to
her
vision
of
her
restaurant
as
a
place
for
people
to
talk
to
one
another
with
a
very
decent
but
affordable
glass
of
wine
and
an
expertly
prepared
plate
of
simply
braised
lamb
shoulder
Prune
s
shutters
are
still
down

Van
der
Leun
s
piece
details
the
plight
of
Kwaneta
Yatrice
Harris
who
incarcerated
for
killing
an
abusive
partner
wrote
her
letters
from
solitary
confinement
in
a
Texas
prison
This
year
a
lot
of
us
have
spent
vast
expanses
of
time
isolated
from
family
and
friends
and
so
for
many
this
story
will
strike
a
chord
When
van
de
Leun
discusses
pandemic
lockdowns
she
states
Those
who
were
alone
began
to
physically
throb
for
human
connection
This
is
a
powerful
concept
if
we
with
all
the
distractions
of
Zoom
and
Netflix
and
pets
can
still
ache
for
human
connection
when
isolating
consider
what
it
must
feel
like
for
those
locked
in
solitary
for
months
with
their
senses
so
deprived
of
stimulation
they
magnify
to
smell
the
guard
s
perfume
hear
the
click
of
shoes
echoing
from
far
away
By
talking
to
Harris
van
de
Leun
gives
us
an
inkling
of
what
it
is
like
to
live
in
a
condition
that
is
classified
as
torture
by
the
United
Nations
serves
no
rehabilitative
purpose
and
causes
mental
health
to
deteriorate
in
as
few
as
ten
days
A
registered
nurse
Harris
is
terrified
of
COVID-19
and
the
unsanitary
conditions
she
finds
herself
in
her
unit
is
rarely
cleaned
and
she
showers
in
one
of
three
showers
shared
by
forty-two
women
This
essay
also
echoes
another
horrific
event
of
2020
the
death
of
George
Floyd
killed
during
his
arrest
in
Minneapolis
The
racism
that
Black
people
experience
at
the
hands
of
the
police
can
extend
to
prison
wardens
In
Texas
in
2015
a
Black
man
named
Mark
Sabbie
was
feeling
unwell
he
was
given
a
disciplinary
ticket
for
creating
a
disturbance
by
feining
[
sic
]
illness
and
difficulty
breathing
He
was
cuffed
in
his
cells
and
left
alone
and
found
dead
the
next
morning
An
emotional
read
but
an
important
look
at
how
the
challenges
wider
society
has
faced
in
2020
are
magnified
inside
the
microcosm
of
a
Texas
prison
What
does
it
mean
to
be
criminally
insane
The
official
answer
sounds
simple
to
have
a
mental
illness
that
impairs
you
from
telling
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
But
mental
illness
is
a
nuanced
spectrum
and
to
many
it
seems
impossible
to
decipher
someone
s
state
of
mind
during
a
crime
This
story
is
a
fascinating
exploration
into
the
complexities
of
the
insanity
plea
in
the
United
States
which
even
though
there
are
lots
of
tests
and
things
you
can
do
to
kind
of
back
up
your
intuition
…
in
the
end
it
s
kind
of
this
gut
feeling
Using
the
case
study
of
Anthony
Montwheeler
Fischer
explores
what
can
happen
when
a
gut
feeling
isn
t
enough
Montwheeler
apparently
played
the
system
Charged
in
1996
with
kidnapping
his
wife
and
son
at
gunpoint
he
was
found
guilty
except
for
insanity
Twenty
years
later
he
claimed
he
faked
mental
illness
by
studying
a
copy
of
the
Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental
Disorders
and
mimicking
behavioral
traits
to
avoid
incarceration
in
favor
of
a
state
psychiatric
hospital
and
now
wanted
to
be
discharged
After
he
spoke
at
a
hearing
for
a
total
of
eight-and-a-half
minutes
a
review
board
decided
Montwheeler
was
no
longer
affected
by
a
qualifying
mental
disease
or
defect
and
the
state
was
legally
required
to
discharge
him
Had
Montwheeler
been
pretending
all
those
years
It
seems
no
one
really
knows
for
sure
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
after
his
release
he
went
on
to
murder
his
third
ex-wife
Annita
Harmon
This
case
is
a
rarity
the
insanity
defense
is
pursued
in
fewer
than
one
percent
of
all
criminal
trials
But
however
hard
to
define
mental
health
is
still
an
obvious
factor
in
crime
37
percent
of
prisoners
and
44
percent
of
jail
inmates
have
been
told
by
a
mental
health
professional
at
some
point
in
their
lives
that
they
suffer
from
a
mental
disorder
Fischer
shows
that
while
the
insanity
defense
may
be
flawed
there
is
still
a
clear
link
between
mental
health
and
criminality
with
a
lack
of
mental
health
care
and
the
resulting
issues
apparent
Greenberg
is
meticulous
in
his
detailed
analysis
of
Marcus
Hutchins
character
a
hacker
who
some
view
as
a
criminal
and
others
as
the
savior
of
the
internet
It
s
a
thrilling
story
with
many
twists
and
turns
but
also
an
exploration
into
people
s
moral
complexities
Hutchins
stopped
the
worst
malware
attack
the
world
had
ever
seen
christened
WannaCry
In
the
space
of
an
afternoon
it
destroyed
by
some
estimates
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
computers
data
before
Hutchins
found
the
kill
switch
He
was
celebrated
as
a
hero
but
Hutchins
himself
knew
what
it
was
like
to
sit
behind
a
keyboard
detached
from
the
pain
inflicted
on
innocents
far
across
the
internet
Three
years
earlier
he
had
been
the
chief
author
of
Kronos
a
type
of
malware
focused
on
stealing
banking
login
credentials
After
disabling
WannaCry
Hutchins
previous
work
with
Kronos
was
discovered
and
he
was
arrested
The
hacker
world
rallied
in
support
which
left
Hutchins
ravaged
by
guilt
for
what
he
had
done
but
even
the
judge
in
his
trial
concluded
that
one
might
view
the
ignoble
conduct
that
underlies
this
case
as
against
the
backdrop
of
what
some
have
described
as
the
work
of
a
hero
a
true
hero
This
is
a
thought-provoking
insight
into
the
gradual
descent
into
a
criminal
world
the
climb
back
out
again
and
the
layers
of
gray
in
between
It
feels
jarring
to
put
the
terms
beautiful
and
lynching
in
the
same
sentence
but
this
personal
essay
about
the
1947
lynching
of
Willie
Earle
is
beautifully
written
Guess
writing
is
almost
lyrical
as
she
explains
how
the
wind
blew
history
into
my
path
in
wonderfully
descriptive
language
When
Guess
moved
into
her
farmhouse
in
Georgia
she
found
a
box
of
old
newspapers
from
the
mid-1940s
through
the
early
50s
She
stored
them
in
the
woodshed
until
a
blustery
autumn
storm
disturbed
them
and
scattered
them
about
the
property
One
headline
that
appeared
like
a
bird
I
had
been
expecting
in
this
landscape
that
carries
memories
of
racialized
violence
read
State
Seeks
Death
Sentence
For
All
31
Lynchers
Not
ready
for
the
emotional
toll
of
exploring
this
incident
further
Guess
tucked
the
paper
away
but
the
story
wanted
to
be
told
and
a
few
weeks
later
the
wind
blew
the
conclusion
across
the
garden
28
White
Men
Get
Blanket
Acquittal
in
South
Carolina
Mass
Lynch
Trial
It
was
Willie
Earle
who
was
killed
to
avenge
the
fatal
stabbing
of
a
cab
driver
named
Thomas
Brown
Arrested
then
almost
immediately
kidnapped
from
jail
Earle
had
no
opportunity
to
stand
trial
his
guilt
or
innocence
was
never
proven
His
murderers
were
given
that
chance
but
despite
ample
evidence
and
confessions
were
found
innocent
Guess
work
focuses
on
dismantling
racism
in
Georgia
so
it
seemed
fate
that
this
story
literally
landed
at
her
feet
She
went
on
to
research
the
history
of
the
Willie
Earle
murder
discovering
it
was
considered
the
last
lynching
in
South
Carolina
and
although
the
trial
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice
it
marked
the
end
of
mob
violence
and
the
beginning
of
a
rumbling
that
eventually
became
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
Amongst
one
or
two
other
things
2020
was
the
year
people
learned
the
names
Joe
Exotic
and
Carole
Baskin
The
Netflix
series
Tiger
King
landed
on
our
screens
at
the
same
time
that
many
of
us
were
in
lockdown
due
to
COVID-19
and
was
binge-watched
by
millions
This
story
by
Rachel
Nuwer
was
written
before
we
met
these
characters
on
Netflix
while
clutching
our
loo
rolls
and
hand
sanitizer
and
her
piece
sheds
a
brighter
light
on
their
complicated
personalities
Nuwer
s
piece
explores
the
murder-for-hire
plots
that
Exotic
instigated
against
Baskin
but
her
focus
also
remains
firmly
on
the
animals
around
which
the
story
revolves
Exotic
was
not
only
convicted
of
murder-for-hire
but
of
17
wildlife
crimes
including
illegally
killing
five
tigers
and
trafficking
them
across
state
lines
a
significant
conviction
when
there
is
still
no
oversight
over
big
cat
ownership
by
the
federal
government
This
investigation
goes
beyond
the
larger
than
life
characters
and
the
human
drama
and
actually
shows
us
the
lives
of
the
animals
that
are
owned
by
America

big
cat

Her
provocative

with
their
genre-remaking

and
sweeping
claims
about
20th-century
American
culture
In

Rather
than

we

an
erotics
of
art
reads
its
killer
line
A
woman
of
endless
creative
energy
she
did
not
like
people
to
know
she
slept
in
addition
to
writing
essays
she
was
a
film
director
activist
and
authored
fiction
The
conversations
prompted
by
her
art
fiercely
propelled
her
reputation
But
it
was
never
just
about
the
work
itself
for
Sontag
s
persona
extends
far
beyond
her
person
As
she
shifted
our
concepts
of
illness
photography
and
visual
media
she
infected
the
public
with
a
larger-than-life
presence
Her
looks
attitude
and
mind
became
a
symbol
of
the
intellectual
It
sufficed
for
a
recognizable
Saturday
Night
Live
impression
for
Julia
Sweeney
to
simply
have
Sontag
s
signature
white
streak
in
front
of
otherwise
thick
black
hair
A
white
streak
to
convey
all
that
Sontag
was
Although
a
towering
thinker
Sontag
has
always
felt
accessible
to
me
through
her
work
I
found
her
as
a
high
schooler
on
a
late
fall
evening
among
the
shelves
of
a
colossal
Barnes
&
Noble
Sigrid
Nunez
s
Sempre
Susan
caught
my
eye
The
details
of
my
discovery
are
hazy
but
the
intensity
of
its
influence
persists
At
the
time
I
was
just
beginning
to
realize
my
queerness
and
consequently
at
a
confused
crisis
point
The
task
of
rebuilding
my
sense
of
self
felt
overwhelming
amidst
my
new
sudden
and
urgent
questions
I
was
scrambling
Meandering
And
suddenly
there
was
Sontag
Who
was
she
This
beacon
of
energy
ideas
opinions
A
model
to
propel
my
imagination
Inspiration
feels
kitschy
she
would
agree
A
stabilizing
force
around
which
I
could
orient
The
pieces
in
this
reading
list
attest
to
a
similarly
personal
relationship
the
writers
developed
with
Sontag
Whether
known
in
real
life
or
just
through
her
work
she
manifests
powerfully
in
individual
psyches
Like
me
the
writers
experienced
Sontag
as
a
teacher
and
mentor
figure
But
the
pieces
are
just
as
divergent
as
she
was
multi-layered
As
such
they
produce
strikingly
unique
accounts
of
her
impact
Being
a
memoir
Nunez
s
Sempre
Susan
was
a
fitting
introduction
for
me
because
I
connect
with
writers
as
people
first
The
book
recounts
Nunez
s
relationship
with
Sontag
as
her
mentee
and
for
a
time
the
girlfriend
of
Sontag
s
son
David
Rieff
It
is
vivid
in
its
account
illustrating
Sontag
in
full
and
taking
care
to
highlight
her
quirks
her
vocabulary
habits
boring
like
servile
was
one
of
her
favorite
words
Another
was
exemplary
Also
serious
her
hatred
of
art
selfishness
it
gave
her
the
utmost
glee
to
share
her
passions
with
others
her
insatiable
desire
for
socialization
and
artistic
pleasures
She
had
a
steady
stream
of
houseguests
hated
being
alone
and
was
constantly
attending
film
screenings
shows
etc
Further
Nunez
s
portrait
succeeds
where
others
fail
in
representing
Sontag
s
complexities
without
reducing
her
to
conclusions
Nunez
for
example
documents
Sontag
s
wittiness
a
side
that
is
unfortunately
lacking
from
many
other
such
works
For
a
woman
in
the
male-dominated
field
of
criticism
respect
was
not
a
given
But
Sontag
s
demand
for
seriousness
has
often
been
overblown
her
reputation
making
her
out
to
be
humorless
Nunez
attests
to
a
different
Sontag
the
one-liners
speak
for
themselves
Nunez
writes
that
once
when
Sontag
was
struggling
to
finish
an
essay
angry
that
we
weren
t
being
supportive
enough
she
said
‘
if
you
won
t
do
it
for
me
at
least
do
it
for
western
culture
Or
In
discussing
an
ex-lover
Sontag
declared
that
there
was
only
one
reason
this
woman
continued
to
make
her
suffer
each
time
Susan
saw
her
‘
If
she
went
around
wearing
a
paper
bag
over
her
head
I
d
be
just
fine
A
hilarious
genius
was
materializing
I
needed
more
Luckily
work
by
and
about
Sontag
is
in
endless
supply
Her
posthumously
published
diaries
Reborn
and
As
Consciousness
is
Harnessed
into
Flesh
are
a
powerful
access
point
Spanning
from
her
teenage
years
well
into
adulthood
they
offer
a
glimpse
into
how
she
shaped
her
mind
Alongside
the
typical
life
updates
are
entries
with
lists
upon
lists
words
to
learn
movies
and
books
to
consume
slang
from
the
gay
community
she
picks
up
forecasting
her
later
Notes
on
Camp
These
document
her
increasing
quest
for
knowledge
to
devour
the
world
whole
She
spends
pages
too
describing
the
art
that
moves
her
In
response
to
music
she
writes
in
Reborn
at
age
15
that
there
are
fleeting
oh
so
quickly
flown
moments
when
I
know
as
surely
as
today
is
Christmas
that
I
am
tottering
over
an
illimitable
precipice
Her
curiosity
is
infectious
as
I
read
the
diaries
I
decided
that
I
too
wanted
to
learn
more
about
everything
And
through
her
clearly
outlined
process
as
an
auto-didact
I
could
try
It
s
now
been
years
since
that
fortuitous
trip
to
Barnes
&
Noble
but
my
interest
has
not
waned
Studying
her
feels
like
speaking
with
a
childhood
friend
even
after
I
have
a
good
sense
of
her
after
all
we
ve
spent
so
much
time
together
I
am
struck
by
something
new
And
that
newness
is
especially
delightful
because
it
readjusts
me
to
her
but
softly
within
expectations
a
friend
whose
familiarity
feels
comforting
as
she
grows
and
changes
with
each
encounter
Reading
her
short
story
Pilgrimage
for
example
endeared
me
to
her
sensitive
side
The
story
though
not
outright
memoir
she
was
famously
anti-autobiographical
is
based
on
her
teenage
encounter
with
her
writer
hero
Thomas
Mann
The
protagonist
is
an
information-greedy
girl
who
keeps
lists
in
her
diaries
discusses
Stravinsky
with
her
friends
on
the
regular
and
yearns
to
venture
past
the
bounds
of
her
family
life
Her
meeting
with
Mann
is
not
what
she
pictures
She
is
embarrassed
throughout
their
conversation
and
frustrated
that
he
does
not
speak
to
her
like
an
adult
The
encounter
disillusions
her
to
the
fantasy
she
had
built
after
feeling
transformed
by
his
book
Would
meeting
Sontag
in
real
life
have
done
the
same
to
me
I
like
to
think
some
fantasies
are
better
left
unbroken
Pilgrimage
is
a
touching
portrayal
to
read
in
parallel
to
the
struggling
hard
on
herself
yet
always
determined
girl
in
the
diaries
For
the
protagonist
comes
across
so
earnest
the
adult
Sontag
handling
her
younger
self
with
such
love
A
lesson
in
reconciling
a
childhood
through
fiction
of
trying
to
make
herself
known
within
the
protection
of
a
story
In
fact
all
her
work
the
essays
the
fiction
the
interviews
the
plays
the
films
the
relationships
speak
to
her
experiments
in
shaping
herself
and
her
mind
Through
her
others
get
to
do
the
same
the
writers
in
this
reading
list
convey
Sontag
s
importance
to
their
development
In
each
I
see
some
of
my
own
connection
to
Sontag
and
hope
you
find
points
of
relation
as
well
It
s
the
thrill
of
Me
too
The
sharing
of
passions
Sontag
so
enjoyed
But
ultimately
our
connections
with
Sontag
are
personal
For
your
Sontag
won
t
be
mine
Terry
Castle
recounts
with
humor
and
alluring
detail
her
dynamic
with
Sontag
As
she
puts
it
their
relationship
was
rather
like
the
one
between
Dame
Edna
and
her
feeble
sidekick
Madge
or
possibly
Stalin
and
Malenkov
Sontag
was
the
Supremo
and
I
the
obsequious
gofer
At
the
time
she
and
Sontag
met
Castle
was
beginning
her
academic
literary
career
at
Stanford
where
she
teaches
to
this
day
Sontag
was
already
a
known
entity
and
Castle
fangirled
hard
Their
first
few
encounters
were
intoxicating
as
meeting
an
idol
ought
to
be
Castle
all
awe
and
nerves
as
she
tries
to
keep
up
But
over
time
their
dynamic
turned
sour
and
they
lost
touch
or
as
Castle
puts
it
more
bluntly
Sontag
lost
interest
Regardless
of
this
turn
of
events
Castle
does
not
turn
to
derision
What
makes
the
piece
stand
out
is
how
acutely
Castle
s
mixed
feelings
come
through
In
cultural
memory
Castle
notes
Sontag
s
vivid
personality
is
still
missing
from
the
spotlight
With
Castle
s
short
but
carefully
specific
narration
Sontag
gets
a
little
more
color
Queer
people
often
have
the
experience
as
children
of
seeing
parts
of
themselves
reflected
in
others
without
knowing
that
this
is
what
they
are
seeing
We

carrier
journalist
Amelia
Abraham
recounts
how
as
a
child
she
unconsciously
sought
representations
of
camp
sensibilities
in
popular
culture
She
describes
the
cultural
touchstones
like
the
aunts
in
Sabrina
the
Teenage
Witch
or
the
Homer
s
Phobia
episode
of
The
Simpsons
that
reflected
and
embraced
her
seemingly
unconventional
preferences
When
she
finally
had
a
name
and
language
for
those
tastes
upon
finding
Sontag
s
essay
Notes
on
Camp
she
saw
in
Sontag
a
queer
hero
As
Abraham
elaborates
Sontag
s
relationship
with
her
queerness
is
complicated
She
only
outed
herself
later
in
life
and
was
reticent
to
speak
about
her
personal
relationships
The
well-documented
fight
between
Sontag
s
prolific
outer
world
and
her
tightly-concealed
inner
world
a
tension
whose
boundaries
are
impossible
to
delineate
helped
Abraham
sort
through
questions
about
motives
in
her
own
writing
career
Returning
to
different
parts
of
Sontag
s
oeuvre
as
her
own
life
evolves
Abraham
sees
Sontag
as
an
enduring
mentor
figure

Koestenbaum

A

Koestenbaum
attends

But
apparently
so
did
Koestenbaum
He
draws
quotes
from
across
her
essays
and
fiction
taking
care
to
comment
on
the
parts
that
intrigue
him
stir

entrance

His
expansive
language
speaks
for
itself
my
words
here
can
not
do
him
justice
But
I
will
leave
you
with
one
more
taste
for
his
zeal
Koestenbaum
not
only
thinks
but
moreover
dreams
in
Sontag
Sontag
has
written
loads
about
sickness
in
essay
collections
like
Illness
as
Metaphor
and
AIDS
and
Its
Metaphors
and
short
stories
like
The
Way
We
Live
Now
Further
she
was
herself
a
frequent
patient
Throughout
her
three
bouts
of
cancer
she
maintained
an
intense
will
to
live
her
first
diagnosis
at
age
40
was
so
dire
she
found
only
one
doctor
with
any
hope
Because
of
his
radical
treatment
live
she
did
Like
Sontag
writer
Tessa
Fontaine
was
diagnosed
young
at
age
21
Though
Fontaine
did
not
find
Illness
as
Metaphor
until
she
was
in
remission
its
arguments
gave
her
community
in
cancer
s
aftermath
Sontag
elucidates
the
detriment
of
using
metaphor
to
discuss
disease
Invoking
the
language
of
warfare
like
invasive
and
survivor
is
commonplace
when
discussing
cancer
In
these
images
the
body
turns
against
itself
and
the
patient
is
both
enemy
and
fighter
The
imagery
affected
Fontaine
s
experience
as
a
cancer
patient
she
developed
a
contentious
relationship
with
her
body
But
she
was
able
through
Sontag
s
work
to
process
those
contentions
and
see
how
they
distort
the
disease
into
something
that
it
is
not
Fontaine
s
copy
of
the
essays
borrowed
from
the
library
had
the
added
charm
of
marginalia
from
a
previous
reader
Fontaine
writes
I
felt
as
if
I
had
joined
a
tiny
collective
None
of
us
knew
each
other
All
of
us
were
uncomfortable
with
the
way
we
related
to
illness
and
felt
alone
in
our
thinking
And
yet
that
s
the
lovely
part
In
the
margins
we
were
not
exactly
alone
In
destigmatizing
illness
Sontag
provided
necessary
relief
to
people
like
Fontaine
When
I
look
back
at
my
journal
from
when
I
had
cancer
though
it
s
clear
that
what
scared
me
most
was
the
new
truth
that
my
body
could
not
be
trusted
There
had
been
a
foreign
invader
living
right
inside
me
My
body
harbored
secret
destructive
agents
I
was
at
war
with
myself—and
because
every
metaphoric
victor
has
its
foil
in
its
opposite
there
was
always
the
chance
that
somewhere
within
me
there
was
the
loser
I
still
have
this
secret
sneaking
belief
that
deep
in
the
center
of
most
of
my
organs
there
are
massive
sticky
boiling
lumps
of
tar
Or
polyps
filled
with
poison
Or
a
little
army
of
diseases
wearing
armor
and
brandishing
swords
ready
to
unleash
If
you
believe
that
you
are
to
blame
for
your
illness
even
in
part
it
is
harder
to
survive
Sontag
writes
If
the
pieces
in
this
reading
list
invoke
Sontag
as
a
mentor
and
teacher
this
one
is
the
most
on
theme
Journalist
and
cultural
critic
A.
O
Scott
presents
a
composition
replete
with
numbered
paragraphs
mirroring
one
would
be
quick
to
note
Sontag
s
own
paragraph
styling
about
his
life
with
Sontag
In
only
the
confines
of
his
mind
that
is
as
he
turned
down
his
one
chance
to
meet
her
He
was
captured
at
an
early
age
Her
work
made
him
eager
for
a
head
full
of
cultural
knowledge
like
hers
But
in
this
relationship
of
such
character-defining
importance
Scott
is
understandably
protective
When
narrating
her
legacy
he
offers
his
frustrations
how
she
a
woman
so
adamant
that
images
do
not
overtake
content
has
been
moved
from
intellect
to
image
Scott
resists
his
cravings
to
right
this
deciding
instead
to
paint
a
more
personal
version
of
Sontag
His
struggle
in
deciding
what
Sontag
to
write
forthright
to
the
reader
fills
the
piece
with
the
hauntings
of
what
he
decides
against
This
doubled
production
along
with
his
embodied
account
of
her
importance
are
a
cup
of
tea
to
warm
the
heart
of
any
Sontag
devotee

Brendan
O
Meara
is
no
stranger
to
talking
about
the
art
and
craft
of
storytelling
In
this
craft-focused
excerpt
we
re
digging
into
Episode
309
in
which
he
interviewed
Atavist
editor-in-chief
Seyward
Darby
and
writer
Kelly
Loudenberg
about
their
work
on
the
latest
issue
of
The
Atavist
Why
do
we
become
writers
What
is
the
impulse
For
many
it
s
being
drawn
to
writers
whose
prose
is
pyrotechnic
The
aspiring
writer
thinks
Man
I
want
to
try
and
do
that
We
know
how
this
story
ends
though
It
never
ends
up
like
that
So
then
what
Being
a
stylist
isn
t
the
only
thing
that
makes
a
writer
great
or
even
good
Sometimes
a
piece
calls
for
holding
back
which
is
what
Atavist
editor-in-chief
Seyward
Darby
sought
from
the
documentary
filmmaker
and
journalist
Kelly
Loudenberg
for
her
piece
The
Caregivers
Kelly
s
piece
chronicles
the
story
of
Danny
Valentine
a
brilliant
artist
whose
path
crossed
with
Janie
and
Buzz
a
Michigan
couple
who
worked
with
incarcerated
artists
Once
Danny
was
released
from
prison
and
Buzz
s
health
was
in
decline
Janie
called
on
Danny
for
some
much-needed
help
Emotion
is
everywhere
in
this
story
and
Darby
and
I
discussed
how
that
can
sometimes
spill
into
sentimentality
This
is
a
piece
where
restraint
is
everything
she
says
Figuring
out
with
Kelly
how
tightly
to
hold
the
reins
and
when
to
slacken
it
a
little
bit
Kelly
who
created
Netflix
true-crime
series
Exhibit
A
and
The
Confession
Tapes
applied
her
documentary
film
background
to
this
her
first
foray
into
longform
written
journalism
As
she
was
sitting
down
to
write
she
says
her
old
storytelling
instincts
kicked
in
Do
I
want
to
storyboard
this
Do
I
want
to
outline
How
am
I
going
to
get
all
this
information
down
As
she
found
out
though
sometimes
the
best
practice
is
to
surrender
to
the
story
Lots
of
stuff
to
unpack
Please
enjoy
this
excerpt
from
Episode
309
of
The
Creative
Nonfiction
Podcast
These
interviews
have
been
lightly
edited
for
clarity
and
concision
Brendan
O
Meara
Every
piece
that
comes
to
your
desk
or
[
contributing
editor
]
Jonah
[
Ogles
]
desk
up
there
there
s
often
an
inherent
puzzle
As
the
editor
of
Kelly
s
piece
what
was
the
puzzle
for
you
to
figure
out
Seyward
Darby
This
definitely
hits
some
different
softer
notes
I
think
than
some
of
the
stuff
we
ve
been
publishing
recently
It
s
a
romance
but
it
s
also
about
friendship
and
it
s
also
about
justice
There
s
a
lot
of
beauty
in
it
There
are
no
cliffhangers
per
se
but
there
are
surprises
So
it
turns
into
figuring
out
where
to
locate
those
but
then
also
to
keep
the
line
between
good
storytelling
and
getting
a
little
too
saccharin
As
a
writer
Kelly
was
already
very
much
in
this
mindset
but
still
as
you
re
editing
it
s
making
sure
you
re
letting
people
s
actions
and
decisions
speak
for
themselves
as
opposed
to
commenting
on
them
That
s
where
you
can
get
into
the
danger
zone
of
over-sentimentalizing
things
Figuring
out
how
to
strike
the
right
balance
between
tugging
at
people
s
heartstrings
and
yanking
at
them
Writing
the
thing
in
such
a
way
where
you
don
t
comment
on
it
is
such
a
hard
place
to
write
from
because
you
have
to
show
so
much
restraint
this
is
especially
true
with
memoir
because
sometimes
you
want
to
defend
or
justify
a
decision
or
at
least
acknowledge
that
for
example
something
was
kind
of
unsavory
But
you
ve
got
to
find
a
way
to
let
the
scene
speak
for
itself
or
to
be
the
bad
guy
or
let
someone
else
be
the
bad
guy
It
s
a
really
hard
thing
to
navigate
as
a
writer
It
is
and
this
is
a
piece
where
restraint
is
everything
So
[
it
involved
]
figuring
out
with
Kelly
how
tightly
to
hold
the
reins
when
to
slacken
a
little
bit
But
really
trying
to
keep
things
in
check
so
the
story
is
speaking
for
itself
and
we
re
not
getting
lost
in
purple
language
or
unnecessary
sentimentality
She
did
a
really
nice
job
with
that
It
s
also
on
the
shorter
side
for
us
8600
words
And
I
think
that
s
because
of
the
intimacy
of
the
story
and
also
because
of
the
restraint
that
was
really
a
priority
in
the
writing
and
editing
process
Kelly
comes
from
a
documentary
film
background
And
at
least
from
the
conversation
I
had
with
her
I
gleaned
that
this
was
her
first
real
foray
into
longform
written
journalism
When
you
re
approached
by
a
writer
who
doesn
t
necessarily
have
the
body
of
work
in
this
vein
how
do
you
make
sure
that
they
can
pull
off
the
piece
they
pitched
if
they
don
t
have
that
body
of
work
I
remember
getting
this
pitch
very
clearly
because
these
three
characters
Janie
Buzz
and
Danny
jumped
off
the
page
immediately
And
I
found
their
story
to
be
an
interesting
confluence
of
a
couple
of
stories
we
ve
heard
before
One
is
stories
about
people
who
support
[
those
]
in
the
U.
S
carceral
system
and
[
the
other
is
]
stories
about
the
people
who
become
surprising
caregivers
for
the
aging
in
America
I
don
t
mean
that
to
say
that
either
of
these
was
overdone
or
trite
the
point
was
that
this
story
had
various
components
of
these
little
genres
of
other
popular
stories
and
I
was
immediately
excited
by
the
way
that
I
saw
those
layers
in
her
pitch
As
a
filmmaker
Kelly
saw
the
story
No
question
For
me
it
was
a
matter
of
talking
to
her
and
getting
a
sense
of
how
close
she
could
get
to
these
folks
and
it
was
pretty
abundantly
clear
that
she
really
had
their
trust
and
support
In
the
editing
process
when
the
first
draft
had
a
bit
too
much
restraint
we
said
okay
let
s
give
it
a
little
bit
more
love
like
let
s
put
a
little
bit
more
flesh
on
the
bones
here
And
she
was
really
excited
by
that
She
said
something
then
I
m
trying
to
remember
exactly
something
along
the
lines
of
editing
is
better
than
taking
a
writing
class
I
love
being
edited
for
that
reason
too
I
feel
like
I
m
learning
in
process
as
opposed
to
a
more
sort
of
instructional
format
Kelly
was
definitely
game
to
try
something
she
d
never
tried
before
But
she
also
just
instinctively
got
what
the
story
was
supposed
to
be
from
the
get-go
And
to
me
that
s
always
the
most
important
thing
It
s
not
can
you
write
the
best
sentences
Are
your
powers
of
description
off
the
charts
It
s
do
you
feel
the
story
And
it
was
just
so
clear
that
Kelly
did
It
was
one
of
those
pitches
I
got
and
immediately
replied
to
because
I
was
just
really
interested
And
I
think
it
was
because
even
in
her
pitch
she
was
already
conveying
that
she
understood
the
power
of
the
story
Sometimes
for
writers
we
may
be
very
seduced
by
stylists
whether
they
be
David
Foster
Wallace
or
Didion
or
John
Jeremiah
Sullivan
you
know
these
people
that
really
just
kind
of
leap
off
the
page
And
I
think
a
lot
of
us
get
into
writing
because
we
re
excited
by
that
And
we
want
to
find
some
sort
of
way
to
contribute
to
that
It
s
such
a
delicate
balance
to
really
surrender
to
the
story
but
also
to
inject
some
style
into
it
without
going
over
the
top
To
be
clear
I
love
a
great
prose
stylist
But
when
in
doubt
let
the
story
do
the
work
That
isn
t
to
say
that
the
writer
is
not
doing
the
work
because
the
writer
had
to
get
the
story
The
writer
had
to
understand
the
story
The
writer
had
to
put
all
of
those
bones
together
I
think
there
s
sometimes
a
misapprehension
that
the
more
words
you
put
on
the
page
the
more
description
you
re
able
to
include
about
a
particular
scene
or
something
[
the
better
]
People
think
that
good
writing
is
ultimately
all
about
style
right
But
I
always
tell
people
focus
on
the
story
and
be
more
restrained
Because
if
you
have
a
good
story
and
you
re
able
to
tell
it
in
such
a
way
that
a
reader
really
wants
to
keep
turning
the
page
or
scrolling
down
then
you
re
succeeding
as
a
writer
even
if
there
s
not
some
flair
or
panache
to
every
sentence
What
comes
to
mind
when
hearing
you
talk
about
this
is
that
being
the
writer
is
effectively
the
drummer
There
are
tendencies
where
a
band
could
be
overstylized
too
many
fills
too
much
tempo
It
feels
like
the
good
writer
who
knows
the
story
is
just
putting
the
right
accent
in
the
right
place
and
keeping
you
moving
along
And
then
when
there
s
really
a
good
opportunity
they
can
be
there
to
hit
the
cymbal
maybe
do
a
little
bit
of
a
flourish
but
it
s
all
in
service
of
accenting
the
other
elements
of
the
band
I
m
one
of
the
bajillion
people
who
loved
Get
Back
the
Beatles
documentary
And
one
of
the
things
I
was
so
struck
by
in
watching
it
was
that
nobody
ever
had
notes
for
Ringo
Like
they
were
all
arguing
about
this
or
that
and
Ringo
was
just
there
doing
his
job
keeping
the
beat
in
an
absolutely
crucial
way
I
know
people
say
Ringo
is
the
best
Beatle
and
after
seeing
that
documentary
it
s
really
hard
to
argue
with
that
not
only
because
he
is
a
great
drummer
but
because
he
s
hilarious
and
gives
no
shits
about
a
lot
of
the
drama
I
understand
exactly
what
you
re
saying
Which
isn
t
to
say
that
the
drummer
can
t
have
a
fantastic
solo
but
it
s
really
about
are
we
keeping
the
song
on
track
It
s
the
backbone
it
s
the
anchor
Given
that
you
have
a
lot
of
experience
in
filmmaking
in
what
way
does
filmmaking
help
your
writing
Kelly
Loudenberg
Well
this
is
my
first
longform
piece
I
mean
I
ve
written
smaller
things
But
this
was
kind
of
more
like
making
a
documentary
I
actually
enjoyed
the
process
a
little
bit
more
because
it
was
more
intimate
I
like
collaboration
but
sometimes
like
when
you
re
working
on
a
story
it
s
kind
of
nice
to
be
just
you
and
the
people
who
you
re
writing
about
I
was
talking
not
just
to
Janie
and
Danny
but
also
all
the
people
in
their
orbit
Janie
s
former
students
Buzz
s
former
students
Buzz
s
work
colleagues
old
friends
from
before
he
knew
Janie
Janie
s
friends
I
kind
of
made
friends
with
one
of
Janie
s
friends
who
s
in
the
piece
and
who
lives
in
LA
now
which
is
really
nice
But
it
s
kind
of
just
getting
to
know
their
whole
world
and
talking
to
everybody
around
it
and
not
just
directly
to
both
of
them
For
both
of
my
documentary
shows
I
would
talk
to
a
lot
of
people
who
I
never
even
planned
on
interviewing
but
who
gave
me
the
right
kind
of
context
and
helped
me
embed
myself
in
their
story
So
I
think
it
was
really
similar
to
that
And
then
the
process
of
writing
is
like
the
process
of
thinking
about
the
structure
of
a
documentary
how
am
I
going
to
unfold
this
story
With
documentary
you
re
more
limited
because
you
have
to
tell
it
with
interviews
and
footage
and
archival
If
you
don
t
have
those
things
you
can
t
really
do
it
But
with
writing
if
you
have
the
scenes
and
they
exist
you
can
write
them
So
it
was
really
more
creative
in
that
way
Making
a
film
you
ve
got
a
crew
you
ve
got
microphones
and
then
here
reporting
is
just
you
and
your
recorder
and
your
notebook
Did
it
feel
more
streamlined
Liberating
It
felt
simpler
I
m
not
saying
it
was
easier
just
that
I
felt
like
I
could
focus
more
I
could
create
things
in
my
head
too
and
it
just
didn
t
have
to
be
the
distraction
of
all
the
crew
and
all
the
money
You
know
when
you
re
doing
shows
there
s
just
a
lot
of
money
weighing
on
each
time
you
go
out
with
a
crew
This
kind
of
reporting
you
don
t
have
to
put
so
much
pressure
on
every
interaction
you
don
t
have
to
get
something
out
of
every
conversation
you
can
just
kind
of
flow
through
it
a
bit
easier
You
alluded
to
structure
earlier
can
you
talk
about
the
structure
of
this
piece
in
particular
but
also
maybe
give
us
an
insight
into
how
the
structure
of
a
documentary
is
similar
or
different
than
a
longform
written
piece
You
can
open
a
documentary
the
same
way
I
open
that
story
Structure
is
one
of
my
favorite
parts
just
figuring
out
[
that
]
it
s
not
just
beginning
middle
and
end
It
s
not
like
I
need
to
go
through
a
chronology
How
am
I
going
to
create
something
interesting
that
somebody
wants
to
read
And
it
s
the
same
thing
with
a
documentary
Within
a
documentary
setting
the
editor
is
also
writing
it
with
you
and
they
re
helping
you
think
through
what
the
structure
should
be
And
you
re
kind
of
talking
back
and
forth
about
it
And
it
s
really
a
huge
part
of
the
shape
and
the
form
that
it
takes
But
I
think
with
documentary
you
are
limited
to
having
the
right
assets
visually
And
if
you
don
t
have
them
visually
you
can
t
do
it
The
opening
element
of
this
piece
is
a
really
nice
scene
I
wrote
in
my
notes
ask
Kelly
how
she
goes
about
reconstructing
something
like
this
So
maybe
you
can
unpack
the
opening
vignette
of
this
piece
that
introduced
Daniel
and
how
you
went
about
reporting
that
The
scene
in
my
head
was
of
Danny
getting
this
call
from
Janie
on
Christmas
Eve
that
she
needed
some
help
she
was
emotionally
exhausted
and
needed
a
backup
And
he
left
the
next
day
Packed
up
his
car
and
came
down
from
the
Upper
Peninsula
I
just
imagined
Danny
on
his
drive
smoking
a
joint
driving
through
this
wicked
snowstorm
and
getting
into
Ann
Arbor
to
this
beautiful
neighborhood
and
this
beautiful
house
and
what
that
scene
must
have
been
like
I
mean
it
was
also
probably
very
stressful
for
people
involved
it
wasn
t
a
perfectly
normal
Christmas
But
you
also
have
to
stick
to
the
facts
You
can
make
the
scene
cinematic
but
it
also
has
to
be
completely
true
I
m
glad
that
we
were
able
to
bring
it
out
I
think
sometimes
in
documentaries
there
is
a
tendency
to
get
further
from
the
truth
That
s
what
s
happening
now
That
s
not
how
we
made
our
shows
and
we
were
very
committed
to
representing
what
actually
happened
But
things
are
getting
more
blurry
in
the
genre
and
it
s
not
something
I
totally
like
Is
it
getting
overstylized
Dramatized
Very
much
I
think
some
things
don
t
need
to
be
documentaries
some
things
are
better
as
a
written
piece
or
a
podcast
or
a
fictional
take
on
that
story
[
When
you
force
it
into
a
documentary
]
sometimes
it
just
stretches
a
little
bit
There
s
not
such
a
strenuous
fact-checking
process
They
don
t
have
an
outsider
coming
in
and
checking
these
things
so
it
s
up
to
the
filmmaking
team
Your
piece
isn
t
all
cinematic
scenes
there
are
more
expositional
informational
sections
as
well
How
did
you
go
about
balancing
the
more
kinetic
scenework
versus
information
the
reader
needs
to
be
fully
immersed
with
these
primary
characters
It
was
a
lot
longer
at
one
point
and
then
Seyward
really
helped
cut
it
back
by
working
to
find
that
balance
of
details
versus
scenework
What
I
began
with
was
something
like
Okay
I
m
going
to
take
as
many
pieces
of
this
and
make
them
into
scenes
and
not
get
too
bogged
down
in
mundane
details
That
s
just
how
I
started
thinking
about
it
and
then
the
editor
helped
me
expand
on
that
and
make
that
even
stronger
A
lot
of
writers
have
their
own
idiosyncrasies
to
get
into
the
flow
of
things
Like
Susan
Orlean
is
all
about
the
lede
she
s
said
she
can
t
proceed
until
the
lede
is
in
place
And
some
people
may
put
that
off
until
later
and
work
on
something
else
What
are
the
things
that
you
like
to
have
in
place
when
you
re
generating
the
thing
I
think
it
was
a
little
bit
scattered
for
me
and
I
d
be
more
organized
next
time
about
how
I
m
looking
through
the
information
before
I
start
writing
At
first
I
was
like
This
is
my
first
time
doing
something
so
long
maybe
I
should
just
outline
it
That
s
what
I
would
do
for
a
documentary
I
would
outline
it
in
a
very
detailed
way
even
put
it
up
on
the
wall
like
some
people
storyboard
a
film
So
I
thought
about
okay
do
I
want
to
storyboard
this
How
am
I
going
to
get
all
this
information
down
But
what
I
actually
did
was
I
just
started
writing
it
And
I
just
kept
going
through
all
the
interviews
and
transcripts
and
talking
to
Danny
and
Janie
along
the
way
So
it
wasn
t
like
I
went
out
and
did
all
the
interviews
and
then
came
to
my
desk
and
started
writing
I
was
actively
interviewing
them
the
whole
time
realizing
that
I
needed
more
here
or
there
and
they
were
just
so
wonderful
about
answering
all
these
questions
and
also
their
memories
are
very
detailed
And
so
they
helped
where
I
needed
to
fill
in
all
of
these
pieces
that
I
didn
t
have
So
for
this
time
at
least
it
was
very
piecemeal
just
working
through
it
until
I
got
through
to
the
end
Because
you
were
kind
of
writing
it
as
you
went
along
did
you
find
that
you
were
spackling
in
holes
with
interviews
here
and
there
Did
you
ever
run
into
an
instance
where
you
felt
like
you
might
have
been
painting
yourself
into
a
structural
corner
that
might
have
been
hard
to
get
out
of
I
knew
the
general
arc
of
the
story
so
I
didn
t
worry
that
the
structure
wouldn
t
work
But
it
s
hard
when
you
don
t
have
a
ton
of
distance
to
know
Is
this
interesting
Does
this
build
does
this
work
So
I
also
had
to
ask
Seyward
if
the
basic
structure
was
working
and
thankfully
it
was
But
there
were
times
too
that
I
was
like
How
much
do
I
want
to
go
into
the
prison
art
world
culture
because
that
s
a
world
unto
itself
that
I
got
to
know
through
Danny
and
other
artists
that
I
ve
interviewed
and
talked
to
who
were
still
incarcerated
and
a
couple
who
are
out
It
was
a
whole
other
world
that
I
just
loved
and
I
think
I
did
at
one
point
go
pretty
far
down
that
rabbit
hole
but
then
we
scaled
it
back
That
s
probably
a
whole
other
piece
right
there
but
not
the
same
thing
The
story
is
so
tender
and
delicate
With
Buzz
s
mind
starting
to
deteriorate
over
the
years
it
can
be
really
hard
to
tease
out
information
and
interview
people
about
such
delicate
subject
matter
So
I
wonder
how
you
went
about
interviewing
Janie
and
Danny
about
things
that
are
so
delicate
and
doing
it
in
a
way
that
honored
their
story
but
also
getting
the
information
you
needed
to
tell
the
story
you
wanted
to
tell
I
just
felt
a
deep
connection
with
both
of
them
When
I
met
Janie
I
had
had
a
baby
born
very
early
She
was
born
three
months
early
and
was
in
the
NICU
for
four-and-a-half
months
and
was
very
sick
And
then
when
she
came
home
it
was
a
process
of
caregiving
that
was
beyond
normal
parenting
I
think
I
was
still
very
very
raw
from
that
experience
almost
still
in
shock
I
can
t
say
how
they
were
but
I
did
feel
a
deep
empathy
and
connection
to
them
through
going
through
this
myself
and
I
felt
like
talking
to
them
helped
me
too
in
a
lot
of
ways
like
we
were
just
having
a
conversation
about
these
things
that
were
really
hard

It

Danny
Valentine
sat
alone
in
his
threadbare
single-wide
trailer
staring
out
a
window
at
green
and
red
holiday
lights
flashing
in
the
distance
It
was
10
p.
m
on
Christmas
Eve
2016
and
the
snow
blanketing
Rock
a
rural
area
in
Michigan
s
Upper
Peninsula
seemed
to
swallow
every
sound
In
the
heavy
silence
Danny
tried
to
fight
off
the
dark
thoughts
that
dogged
him
relentlessly
This
was
one
of
the
hardest
times
of
the
year
for
the
rangy
55-year-old
with
blue
eyes
He
didn
t
have
a
tree
to
decorate
or
a
family
to
eat
a
big
turkey
dinner
with
Fresh
off
parole
after
a
23-year
stint
in
prison
he
didn
t
have
shit
As
Danny
pushed
cigarette
butts
around
an
ashtray
on
the
windowsill
his
phone
rang
On
the
other
end
of
the
line
was
a
woman
She
sounded
like
she
d
been
crying
I
just
can
t
do
it
alone
anymore
the
woman
said
Can
you
please
come
On
Christmas
morning
Danny
got
in
his
black
GMC
pickup
truck
and
drove
12
hours
through
a
wicked
snowstorm
to
Ann
Arbor
It
was
evening
by
the
time
he
pulled
to
a
stop
in
front
of
a
large
house
and
Danny
could
see
lights
reflected
in
the
windows
Even
though
he
d
been
invited
Danny
was
hesitant
to
approach
the
house
It
glowed
with
a
warmth
that
had
been
alien
to
him
his
whole
life
When
he
worked
up
the
courage
to
go
inside
he
entered
through
the
neatly
organized
garage
then
walked
down
a
hallway
The
woman
from
the
phone
was
waiting
in
the
dining
room
Her
name
was
Janie
Paul
She
had
dark
hair
and
she
was
bone-tired
When
she
saw
Danny
she
smiled
Sitting
on
the
couch
nearby
was
Janie
s
husband
He
was
lanky
with
gray
hair
Danny
sat
down
next
to
him
and
patted
his
arm
Hey
Buzz
Danny
said
gently
How
you
doing
Buzz
couldn
t
answer
not
really—but
Danny
knew
that
already
He
was
there
to
help
Buzz
He
d
do
whatever
his
friend
needed
and
he
d
stay
for
as
long
as
it
took
Like
Buzz
Janie
believed
in
art
as
politics
art
as
liberation
art
as
a
means
of
building
bridges
By
the
end
of
the
canoe
trip
they
were
friends
By
the
end
of
the
residency
they
were
in
love
Buzz
Alexander
wasn
t
someone
who
had
often
needed
help
He
got
his
undergraduate
degree
in
English
literature
from
Harvard
continued
on
to
Cambridge
for
his
master
s
translated
poetry
in
Italy
while
writing
verse
of
his
own
then
went
back
to
Harvard
for
a
doctorate
focused
on
the
novel
as
an
art
form
With
his
wife
an
art
history
student
he
became
a
house
parent
in
a
dormitory
then
a
parent
to
two
kids
of
his
own
He
moved
his
family
to
Ann
Arbor
in
the
early
1970s
when
he
accepted
a
teaching
position
at
the
University
of
Michigan
Buzz
would
remain
there
for
the
rest
of
his
career
Participating
in
the
antiwar
movement
while
U.
S
forces
were
in
Vietnam
cemented
Buzz
s
commitment
to
social
justice
and
he
approached
activism
through
his
first
love
the
arts
He
wrote
a
book
Film
on
the
Left
about
radical
documentary
filmmaking
of
the
1930s
and
40s
He
also
traveled
to
Peru
and
participated
in
street
theater
performances
about
community
empowerment
public
health
and
self-discovery
Buzz
was
in
his
fifties
and
divorced
by
the
time
he
met
Janie
Paul
at
an
art
residency
in
the
Adirondacks
in
the
summer
of
1992
She
was
a
painter
and
educator
with
degrees
from
Hunter
College
and
New
York
University
The
first
day
at
breakfast
Janie
recalled
we
were
sitting
in
a
huge
lodge
overlooking
a
lake
and
I
asked
‘
Does
anyone
want
to
go
canoeing
Buzz
took
her
up
on
the
offer
Janie
was
glad
he
did
He
looked
like
Henry
Fonda
she
said
About
a
decade
Janie
s
senior
Buzz
was
tall
and
wiry
with
a
rugged
expressive
face
He
walked
with
a
forward
slant
as
if
eager
to
get
where
he
was
going
and
carried
an
extra-large
backpack
full
of
books
and
yellow
legal
pads
scrawled
with
notes
As
they
paddled
the
canoe
under
canopies
of
trees
Janie
told
Buzz
about
her
experience
as
a
little
girl
landing
on
the
shore
of
Lake
Atitlán
and
being
greeted
by
a
swarm
of
people
Janie
s
father
was
a
prominent
anthropologist
and
in
her
childhood
she
traveled
to
Guatemala
where
he
conducted
fieldwork
studying
the
mysterious
bonesetters
Mayan
healers
who
treated
injuries
with
powers
they
believed
they
derived
through
dreams
On
the
trip
Janie
described
to
Buzz
which
occurred
in
the
early
1950s
she
remembered
sharing
a
bag
of
art
supplies
with
local
children
a
communal
creative
experience
that
would
stay
with
her
forever
Like
Buzz
Janie
believed
in
art
as
politics
art
as
liberation
art
as
a
means
of
building
bridges
By
the
end
of
the
canoe
trip
they
were
friends
By
the
end
of
the
residency
they
were
in
love
The
following
year
Buzz
went
on
sabbatical
and
moved
to
Manhattan
to
be
near
Janie
They
shuttled
between
his
tiny
sublet
on
West
74th
Street
and
her
spacious
loft
which
she
shared
with
other
women
and
their
children
Janie
confided
in
Buzz
that
she
had
spent
time
as
a
young
adult
in
a
controversial
therapy
cult
the
Sullivanians
the
members
disavowed
the
nuclear
family
and
lived—and
slept—together
in
several
apartments
on
the
Upper
West
Side
He
didn
t
judge
her
Janie
and
Buzz
made
love
discussed
human
rights
shared
passages
from
Proust
and
went
to
movies
at
Film
Forum
Buzz
was
taken
by
Janie
s
curiosity
and
passion
for
adventure
She
loved
that
he
was
a
scholar
but
also
down-to-earth
I
could
talk
to
him
about
a
Henry
James
novel
in
the
same
conversation
about
his
experience
giving
sheep
baths
in
Peru
Janie
said
After
that
idyllic
year
had
passed
Buzz
went
home
but
he
and
Janie
couldn
t
stand
being
apart
so
she
looked
for
a
job
near
Ann
Arbor
She
soon
landed
a
coveted
position
teaching
color
theory
in
the
University
of
Michigan
s
art
school
Janie
moved
into
Buzz
s
three-story
Victorian
adjacent
to
campus
To
colleagues
and
friends
they
seemed
inseparable
a
package
deal
Janie
and
Buzz
Buzz
and
Janie
It
would
stay
that
way
for
more
than
twenty
years
Before
meeting
Janie
Buzz
had
led
several
poetry
and
theater
workshops
in
Michigan
s
prisons
He
was
part
of
a
nationwide
community
of
progressive
activists
academics
and
artists
responding
to
the
injustices
of
the
carceral
system
through
arts
programming
By
the
1990s
U.
S
prisons
were
overflowing
with
people
many
of
them
men
and
women
of
color
swept
up
in
the
War
on
Drugs
Since
Buzz
s
arrival
in
Michigan
the
state
s
incarcerated
population
had
leaped
from
under
10,000
to
more
than
30,000
He
believed
the
arts
would
enable
people
trapped
behind
bars
to
express
their
creativity
tell
their
stories
and
find
healing
Buzz
s
workshops
revolved
around
improvisation
including
performances
inspired
by
the
inmates
own
life
experiences
One
play
staged
inside
a
women
s
prison
was
titled
Bodies
on
Slabs
It
took
place
in
a
morgue
where
corpses
came
back
to
life
and
told
the
audience
what
had
happened
to
them
They
soon
found
that
they
couldn
t
get
out
of
the
morgue
couldn
t
escape
their
fate
With
Janie
as
a
partner
Buzz
expanded
the
work
he
was
doing
in
prisons
They
both
thought
academia
was
too
conservative
a
stodgy
bubble
where
people
indulged
in
niche
pursuits
They
preferred
to
invest
their
energy
in
civic
engagement
and
especially
in
making
art
more
accessible
Together
they
formed
the
Prison
Creative
Arts
Project
a
University
of
Michigan
program
dedicated
to
promoting
the
arts
behind
bars
Before
long
their
lives
revolved
around
PCAP
Janie
and
Buzz
hosted
Sister
Helen
Prejean
of
Dead
Man
Walking
fame
and
Jimmy
Baca
a
formerly
incarcerated
poet
memoirist
and
screenwriter
at
their
home
when
they
visited
for
PCAP
events
University
students
came
over
for
potluck
dinners
and
to
discuss
the
injustices
of
U.
S
prisons
In
1996
Janie
and
Buzz
decided
to
put
on
an
exhibition
of
painting
sculpture
and
other
visual
work
created
by
Michigan
prisoners
They
knew
from
experience
that
there
were
men
and
women
in
the
state
s
incarcerated
population
who
were
producing
exceptional
art
that
too
often
went
overlooked
The
PCAP
show
would
be
held
at
one
of
the
university
s
art
galleries
where
students
and
colleagues
as
well
as
the
family
and
friends
of
the
participants
could
see
it
The
works
would
be
for
sale
with
proceeds
going
to
the
artists
To
get
the
project
started
Janie
and
Buzz
asked
contacts
at
the
prisons
where
PCAP
worked
to
recommend
incarcerated
artists
Phil
Klintworth
the
activities
director
at
a
prison
in
the
city
of
Jackson
suggested
a
guy
who
in
his
words
could
do
anything
The
man
had
volunteered
to
clean
up
after
the
prison
s
clay
workshops
even
though
he
didn
t
participate
in
them
Day
after
day
month
after
month
he
filled
a
five-gallon
bucket
with
scraps
of
clay
from
other
prisoners
work
spaces
He
used
those
leftovers
to
sculpt
an
array
of
figures
including
mermaids
and
ballerinas
When
he
didn
t
have
clay
he
used
other
items—toilet
paper
and
soap
for
instance—in
his
work
Anything
he
could
get
his
hands
on
Klintworth
told
Buzz
the
man
used
to
make
something
beautiful
People
at
the
prison
had
taken
notice
When
a
guard
was
renovating
his
bar
at
home
he
paid
the
artist
a
few
hundred
dollars
for
hand-sculpted
figures
including
a
pair
of
dolphins
The
inmate
also
drew
family
portraits
for
guards
and
for
other
men
doing
time
for
$
100
a
head—or
if
he
liked
you
$
50
He
based
them
on
photographs
and
they
were
strikingly
realistic
The
sales
were
aboveboard
made
through
official
channels
inside
the
prison
Buzz
was
impressed
He
knew
right
away
that
he
wanted
the
artist
to
be
part
of
PCAP
s
first
exhibition
To
find
out
if
the
man
would
be
interested
Buzz
wrote
him
a
letter
He
was
prisoner
number
156689
His
name
was
Daniel
Valentine
When
Danny
was
six
his
grandmother
gave
him
a
coloring
book
full
of
dinosaurs
and
spaceships
He
added
his
own
figures
and
shapes
He
didn
t
understand
why
he
should
color
someone
else
s
drawing
Danny
grew
up
in
a
blue-collar
family
on
the
outskirts
of
Ann
Arbor
the
second
of
five
kids
His
mom
Mary
worked
in
an
auto-parts
factory
and
sometimes
held
other
jobs
to
make
ends
meet
His
dad
a
mechanic
was
an
abusive
but
good
man
Danny
said
He
once
whipped
Danny
with
a
fan
belt
from
one
of
the
trucks
he
used
for
work
Sometimes
he
d
make
Danny
pay
for
the
food
he
ate
Mary
was
afraid
of
her
husband
he
d
once
threatened
to
hit
her
with
a
crowbar
she
told
me
But
given
the
time
she
spent
working
she
didn
t
witness
much
of
the
abuse
he
inflicted
on
their
children
She
did
recall
one
occasion
when
she
caught
her
husband
on
the
verge
of
purposefully
breaking
Danny
s
leg
Amid
the
violence
at
home
Danny
was
able
to
teach
himself
to
draw
According
to
Mary
when
Danny
was
six
his
grandmother
gave
him
a
coloring
book
full
of
dinosaurs
and
spaceships
He
added
his
own
figures
and
shapes
He
didn
t
understand
why
he
should
color
someone
else
s
drawing
Danny
ran
away
when
he
was
12
in
response
his
dad
called
the
cops
This
kicked
off
Danny
s
long
career
in
the
carceral
system
He
spent
time
in
juvenile
detention
ran
away
and
was
locked
up
again
for
fleeing
It
happened
over
and
over
Danny
was
an
escape
artist
a
regular
juvie
Houdini
He
once
faked
a
leg
injury
so
that
he
could
be
sent
for
X-rays
at
a
hospital
there
he
went
into
a
bathroom
climbed
into
the
drop
ceiling
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
facility
Another
time
Danny
jumped
on
the
desk
in
his
cell
until
he
loosened
the
iron
fixture
that
secured
it
to
the
wall
enough
that
he
could
remove
it
entirely
Danny
waited
for
weeks
for
a
thunderstorm
to
come
he
knew
that
in
bad
weather
the
guards
were
required
to
turn
off
the
motion
sensors
in
the
yard
Once
the
rain
started
he
used
the
iron
fixture
to
break
the
window
in
his
cell
and
pry
the
bars
apart
until
he
could
fit
his
head
through
the
opening
and
wiggle
his
way
out
He
hid
out
for
months
in
an
empty
cabin
belonging
to
his
uncle
before
the
authorities
found
him
While
his
home
life
was
dangerous
Danny
was
no
safer
in
detention
centers
He
was
an
attractive
boy
with
girlish
features
and
curly
blond
hair
According
to
Danny
he
was
sexually
assaulted
many
times
When
he
was
17
locked
up
in
an
adult
prison
for
stealing
a
motorcycle
security
came
in
the
form
of
a
boyfriend
He
was
one
of
these
guys
who
was
feared
among
everybody
in
the
prison
Danny
said
He
was
a
real
gruesome-looking
guy
But
with
Danny
the
man
was
soft
sensitive
He
wouldn
t
show
this
side
to
nobody
else
but
he
would
show
it
to
me
and
it
was
beautiful
Danny
said
The
man
bought
Danny
coats
from
guys
on
the
yard
and
cookies
and
ice
cream
from
the
commissary
As
an
adult
Danny
continued
to
break
the
law
He
said
he
never
carried
a
gun
or
intentionally
hurt
anyone
He
was
mostly
trying
to
survive
shoplifting
food
and
once
stealing
a
car
a
Chevy
Impala
with
a
vinyl
top
for
shelter
He
lived
in
the
car
for
two
months
of
a
brutal
Michigan
winter
During
stints
behind
bars
Danny
drew
At
one
point
a
friend
gave
him
a
tablet
of
paper
and
a
set
of
Prismacolor
pencils
They
were
like
magic
Danny
said
He
liked
to
draw
people
doing
everyday
things
With
the
right
pencils
he
could
mimic
the
chrome
of
a
motorcycle
or
the
fuzzy
texture
of
a
mother
s
bathrobe
Sometimes
he
coated
the
tips
of
his
pencils
with
wax
to
achieve
interesting
effects
on
the
page
During
one
period
Danny
was
free
for
about
a
year
He
picked
up
odd
jobs
pumping
gas
and
working
in
hotels
before
landing
a
position
at
an
art
gallery
in
downtown
Ann
Arbor
According
to
Danny
the
gallerist
was
also
an
amateur
photographer
a
poor
man
s
Hugh
Hefner
who
liked
to
photograph
beautiful
scarcely
clothed
women
particularly
university
students
He
paid
his
models
ten
dollars
an
hour
and
sometimes
supplied
them
with
booze
and
cocaine
during
shoots
An
admirer
and
collector
of
old
pinup
drawings
the
gallerist
asked
Danny
to
render
the
photographs
he
took
as
illustrations
to
sell
One
day
the
gallerist
hung
a
few
of
Danny
s
artworks
in
the
gallery
Two
of
them
sold
a
colored-pencil
drawing
of
a
muscled
woman
sitting
on
a
motorcycle
and
a
pen-and-ink
drawing
of
a
woman
s
half-shadowed
face
Danny
made
about
$
1,500
It
was
a
first
for
me
a
big
deal
he
said
I
thought
I
had
arrived
He
promptly
went
out
to
celebrate—and
burn
through
the
money
he
d
earned—at
a
biker
bar
and
strip
club
called
Leggs
Lounge
It
was
the
kind
of
place
Danny
said
that
had
a
room
designated
for
blow
jobs
He
was
having
a
blast
snorting
coke
while
stuffing
cash
into
the
countless
G-strings
when
a
pair
of
sex
workers
solicited
Danny
promising
him
a
night
of
erotic
splendor
Danny
later
claimed
that
he
paid
one
of
the
women
up
front
and
when
she
ran
off
with
the
money—plus
some
extra
she
d
taken
from
his
pocket—he
and
the
other
woman
agreed
that
he
d
settle
up
with
her
when
they
were
done
They
went
back
to
his
place
where
according
to
Danny
the
woman
refused
to
do
what
they
d
agreed
upon
so
he
didn
t
pay
her
His
landlord
who
also
happened
to
be
his
employer
the
gallerist
later
informed
him
that
cops
had
come
by
looking
for
him
After
evading
the
police
for
a
few
months
Danny
was
arrested
for
rape
He
denied
the
charge
but
a
jury
found
him
guilty
Danny
was
given
20
to
30
years
in
prison
and
he
started
his
sentence
at
a
correctional
facility
in
Jackson
His
only
lifeline
was
his
art—and
in
time
his
wife
Danny
had
been
dating
a
woman
named
Diane
for
a
few
months
before
he
was
locked
up
She
loved
him
and
she
was
loyal—she
d
been
there
every
day
of
his
trial
sitting
alone
on
his
side
of
the
courtroom
Danny
s
family
was
nowhere
to
be
found
Now
Diane
racked
up
hundreds
of
dollars
a
month
in
phone
bills
calling
him
in
prison
She
sent
him
clothes
and
helped
him
buy
art
supplies
She
spent
as
much
time
as
she
could
seated
across
from
him
in
the
prison
s
hollow
sunless
visiting
room
After
Danny
had
served
a
year
of
his
sentence
he
and
Diane
decided
to
get
married
Danny
asked
the
prisoner
in
the
cell
next
to
him
to
be
his
best
man
Diane
wore
a
thrift-store
blazer
and
dress
They
kissed
through
a
bulletproof
window
Together
the
newlyweds
came
up
with
a
plan
to
get
Danny
back
on
his
feet
financially
once
he
was
out
of
prison
Danny
would
mail
Diane
the
art
he
made
in
his
cell
and
she
d
sell
it
in
Ann
Arbor
They
assumed
Diane
could
get
more
for
Danny
s
drawings
and
sculptures
on
the
outside
than
he
could
hawking
them
to
guards
and
other
prisoners
But
the
plan
didn
t
work
Diane
wasn
t
an
art
dealer—she
was
a
nurse
supporting
an
adopted
daughter
She
wasn
t
sure
how
to
sell
Danny
s
work
or
to
whom
The
relationship
eventually
became
tense
the
couple
s
calls
and
visits
routinely
ended
in
anger
Diane
moved
several
hours
away
for
a
new
job
and
began
seeing
a
doctor
from
the
practice
where
she
worked
When
divorce
papers
arrived
at
the
prison
Danny
signed
them
Without
Diane
Danny
had
no
one
I
had
not
one
person
to
call
he
said
and
that
s
a
lonely
desolate
hopeless
space
to
be
in
He
figured
that
he
d
be
almost
sixty
by
the
time
he
got
out
and
without
money
or
a
family
to
support
him
not
much
good
could
happen
after
that
Danny
spiraled
into
a
deep
depression
He
saw
no
way
out

The
Atavist
By
Lindsay
Eanet
I
m
writing
this
to
the
blissful
soundtrack
of
potatoes
hissing
in
a
cast-iron
pan
the
smell
of
caramelization
beginning
to
permeate
our
apartment
My
wife
is
preparing
for
a
sacred
day
of
obligation
in
our
house
the
first
home
match
of
our
local
soccer
club
Tomorrow
morning
the
potatoes
will
fill
her
artfully-wrapped
breakfast
burritos
be
stacked
into
a
cooler
and
ultimately
line
the
Malört-addled
bellies
of
our
friends
and
community
members
at
the
massive
pre-match
tailgate
Her
burritos
are
a
display
of
care
to
friends
and
scarf-wearing
strangers
alike
all
bound
together
by
our
love
for
and
frustration
with
11
men
wearing
the
same
crest
on
their
chests
That
crest
proved
to
be
my
conduit
to
the
experience
of
being
part
of
a
fan
community
In
the
years
since
I
first
attended
a
Chicago
Fire
match
on
a
date
and
got
swept
up
in
the
exhilaration
of
the
supporters
section
I
ve
made
lifelong
friends
one
of
whom
even
stood
up
in
our
wedding
traveled
to
exotic
places
like
Minneapolis
and
participated
in
service
days
and
fundraisers
and
yes
tailgates
I
ve
also
watched
grown
adults
argue
with
each
other
for
days
on
end
over
years-old
petty
grievances
and
engage
in
intricate
mental
gymnastics
to
explain
why
the
homophobic
chant
they
kept
using
is
not
in
fact
homophobic
I
ve
even
imbibed
a
cocktail
of
Malört
and
mojito
mix
a
combination
I
wish
on
no
one
As
it
turns
out
I
love
learning
about
other
people
s
experiences
with
fandom
almost
as
much
as
I
love
experiencing
it
firsthand
the
passion
the
enthusiasm
the
feeling
of
belonging
to
something
greater
just
the
extremity
of
it
all
Have
I
ever
seen
a
full
episode
of
the
BBC
series
Sherlock
No
Have
I
spent
half
a
day
tumbling
down
a
YouTube-and-Tumblr
rabbit
hole
learning
everything
I
possibly
can
about
the
Johnlock
Conspiracy
Yes
absolutely
yes
I
love
talking
and
reading
about
fandom
because
it
is
the
very
best
and
worst
of
us
It
s
joy
and
toxicity
pleasure
and
heartbreak
bond
and
betrayal
It
gets
at
our
most
human
urges
to
share
the
things
we
love
with
others
to
seek
community
among
like-minded
peers
especially
at
a
time
when
we
are
all
still
too
far
apart
It
can
inspire
the
best
and
worst
beyond
its
own
confines
as
well
whether
that
s
a
community
food
drive
or
a
violent
insurrection
Such
duality
informs
some
of
my
favorite
recent
writings
about
fandom
and
fan
communities
pieces
that
celebrate
the
curiosity
joy
and
intrigue
of
fandom
but
also
illuminate
what
fandom
can
teach
us
about
ourselves
and
our
relationships
with
each
other
I
hope
you
enjoy
them
as
much
as
I
did
Amanda
Hess
wasn
t
the
first
person
to
write
about
straight
women
writing
slash
fanfic
but
the
insights
here
last
long
after
the
lads
of
One
Direction
have
gone
off
in
several
different
…
well
you
know
Specifically
the
piece
focuses
on
Larry
shippers
1D
fans
who
wanted
band
members
Harry
Styles
and
Louis
Tomlinson
to
be
a
romantic
couple
and
in
some
cases
spread
a
conspiracy
theory
that
the
two
were
secretly
together
Hess
thoughtfully
calls
out
a
conflict
at
the
heart
of
the
phenomenon
a
2010s
boy
band
that
s
cut
from
the
musical
cloth
of
its
‘
90s
predecessors
but
also
clinging
to
that
era
s
reductive
attitudes
around
gender
and
sexuality
She
suggests
that
as
society
changes
writing
romantic
stories
involving
two
men
in
this
case
Larry
gives
young
female
fans
an
opportunity
to
explore
an
equitable
loving
relationship
But
never
before
has
the
straight
girl
s
queer
imagination
so
totally
disrupted
the
intended
purpose
of
the
men
marketed
to
her
Five
straight
boys
designed
to
appeal
to
straight
girls
heterosexually
Now
the
fantasies
of
girls
like
Cassady
are
threatening
to
redefine
the
teeny-bopper
sexual
dynamic
forever
one
chapter
at
a
time
So-called
Disney
adults
have
long
been
the
subject
of
fascination
and
derision
often
ridiculed
for
their
fevered
nostalgia
for
a
large
entertainment
conglomerate
for
waiting
seven
hours
for
a
Figment
popcorn
bucket
or
for
committing
that
grave
internet
sin
of
being
indefinably
cringe
This
fascination
can
be
seen
in
the
rash
of
reporting
over
the
past
few
years
on
the
Disneyland
Social
Clubs
groups
of
adults
with
biker-gang
cosplay
aesthetics
and
names
like
Neverlanders
and
Main
Street
Elite
joyfully
roaming
the
park
EJ
Dickson
s
feature
goes
beyond
the
usual
rubbernecking
of
the
social
clubs
aesthetics
and
internecine
drama
Instead
she
grounds
their
existence
within
larger
cultural
contexts
such
as
the
unique
relationship
Southern
California
locals
have
to
Disneyland
No
one
can
really
agree
on
who
came
up
with
the
jackets
or
the
denim
garments
that
differentiate
social
club
members
from
your
average
theme
park
attendee
But
Taylor
says
that
the
general
outsider
aesthetic…
is
very
much
rooted
in
Southern
California
culture…
Taylor
also
draws
parallels
between
the
cheery
recklessness
of
the
West
Coast
punk
and
ska
scene
and
the
relentlessly
sunny
push
toward
growth
and
innovation
embodied
by
Walt
Disney
himself
They
have
an
appreciation
for
what
Disney
built
there
this
utopia
with
fantastical
optimism
The
past
few
years
have
led
to
rifts
in
many
fan
communities
over
the
harmful
actions
or
beliefs
of
the
creators
they
once
loved
the
betrayal
felt
by
many
devoted
Harry
Potter
fans
at
J.
K
Rowling
s
transphobic
remarks
being
perhaps
the
most
discussed
example
But
similar
reckonings
are
happening
in
fandoms
all
over
popular
culture
In
the
community
devoted
to
‘
90s
pop
trio
Hanson
many
fans
are
leaving
after
feeling
alienated
or
betrayed
by
the
band
s
responses
or
rather
lack
thereof
to
the
murder
of
George
Floyd
and
subsequent
nationwide
protests
as
well
as
to
COVID-19
public
health
measures
Spencer
s
article
explores
another
increasingly
important
conversation
Fan
communities
can
be
a
hotbed
for
destructive
harmful
behavior
and
some
of
the
fans
Spencer
interviewed
expressed
anger
and
frustration
that
the
brothers
didn
t
intervene
when
their
Black
fans
were
being
attacked
How
should
fans
respond
when
a
creator
reinforces
a
toxic
ingroup/outgroup
dynamic
While
those
marketing
tactics
have
bred
fierce
loyalty
they
ve
also
proven
exclusionary
Hanson
set
up
this
cult
mentality
of
either
you
re
in
or
you
re
out

Janice
who
threw
her
fan
club
CD
straight
in
the
trash
when
it
arrived
this
summer
before
she
could
cancel
her

It
s
just
a
bubble
now
If
you
re
outspoken
you
re
not
in
it
or
you
re
attacked
by
other
fans
Remember
back
when
the
internet
was
fun
before
doomscrolling
was
a
word
and
strangers
with

start
talking
at
you
about

That
s
how
the
burgeoning
world
of
virtual

is
now
thanks
in
part
to
the
generosity
creativity
and
technological
know-how
of
one

What
do
creators
and
fans
owe
to
each
other
Social
media
and
convention
culture
have
made
creators
more
accessible
than
ever
especially
in
the
worlds
of
science
fiction
and
fantasy
and
with
that
comes
the
pressure
for
creators
to
stay
in
constant
conversation
with
their
fans
and
produce
and
maintain
a
supplemental
brand
Miller
goes
deep
on
the
impassioned
fanbase
of
author
George
R.
R
Martin
and
his
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire
series
this
article
originally
dropped
a
week
before
Game
of
Thrones
premiered
on
HBO
the
joy
of
building
community
and
the
pressure
of
maintaining
it
and
the
frustration
and
hostility
directed
at
Martin
when
fans
had
to
wait
years
for
him
to
finish
the
latest
installment
of
the
series
It
s
an
incisive
look
at
the
pull
between
fan
and
customer
and
what
happens
when
fans
base
their
expectations
of
a
creator
based
on
what
came
before
Martin
told
me
that
many
of
his
fans
assume
that
he
is
as
meticulous
a
world-builder
as
Tolkien
was
They

beyond

The

has
become

When
I
talked
to
stans
they
told
me
about
their
interactions
with
campaign

who
solicited
their

When
I
talked
to

they
sometimes
spoke
warily
about
off-the-rails
grassroots

and
urged
that
they
couldn

But
everyone
is
watching
what
happens
on
Twitter
where
press

When
the
world
is
a
nightmare
there
are
few
things
more
satisfying
to
read
about
than
low-stakes
beef
in
an
ultra-niche
hobby
that
you
would
otherwise
know
nothing
about
But
this
colorful
deep
dive
into
the
sugary
frenzy
of

is
about
far
more
than

After
the
initial
gleeful
haze
of
remembering

comes
a
nutritionally
dense
and
satisfying

touching
on
the
dynamics
of
communities
forged
by
nostalgia
sense
memory
and
the
corporate
symbiosis
between
fandom

that

All

The
intensity
of
the

may
seem
odd
to
outsiders
but
it
begins
to
make
sense
when
you
consider
how
much
of
this
subculture
is
built
around
nostalgia
Cereal
can
be
a
connection
to
the
past
Eating
a
bowl
of
a
decades-old
classic
like
Lucky

Cinnamon

be

There
is
a
large
gap
in
my
reading
life
between
being
a
Very
Online
Child
who
browsed
fanfiction
net
for
Redwall-inspired
epics
wherein
bright-eyed
young
writers
conjured
brawny
otter
original
characters
to
fight
alongside
Martin
the
Warrior
and
quarantine
when
I
began
spending
inordinate
amounts
of
time
on
the
sprawling
fanfiction
repository
known
as
Archive
of
Our
Own
or
AO3
My
interim
dalliances
with
fanfic
were
mostly
for
irony
s
sake
think
giving
dramatic
readings
of
My
Immortal
but
in
seeking
a
rabbit
hole
to
escape
down
while
the
world
was
going
to
shit
I
learned
to
stop
worrying
and
love
fanfiction
There
s
a
lot
I
love
about
this
piece
by
Hannah
Cohen
but
in
particular
I
love
her
assertion
that
fanfiction
is
fiction
at
its
core
On
AO3
writers
write
hundreds
of
thousands
of
words
the
equivalent
of
multiple
novels
and
share
them
with
the
world
simply
for
the
love
of
writing
and
engaging
with
a
work
they
adore
I
never
want
to
forget
the
feeling
of
writing
for
the
sake
of
creative
freedom
I
want
a
release
from
the
productivity
mill
No
more
racing
to
the

of
the

We
are

Two
men
are
dead
in
a
cabin
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
how
did
they
die
There
is
a
whole
host
of
questions
like
this
riddles
that
get
grouped
under
the
category
of
lateral
thinking
puzzles
Another
A
man
walks
into
a
restaurant
and
orders
the
albatross
soup
After
finishing
the
soup
he
leaves
and
commits
suicide
Why
Or
There
is
a
dead
man
naked
in
the
desert
holding
a
straw
How
did
he
die
You
can
only
ask
yes-or-no
questions
and
the
goal
is
to
figure
out
the
precise
story
Many
of
these
involve
a
dead
man
in
one
form
or
another
There
is
a
dead
man
with
a
hole
in
his
suit
how
did
he
die
Sometimes
the
mechanism
of
the
answer
is
something
ludicrously
complex
a
thing
that
must
be
pieced
out
bit
by
bit
Several
people
were
in
a
hot
air
balloon
that
drifted
into
the
desert
and
started
to
lose
altitude
because
of
the
heat
and
air
pressure
They
threw
everything
they
could
overboard
including
their
clothes
but
when
that
wasn
t
enough
they
drew
straws
to
see
who
would
jump
overboard
to
save
the
others
Other
times
though
the
solution
is
simpler
but
requires
retooling
your
perspective
You
hear
hole
in
his
suit
and
you
think
of
a
three-piece
suit
and
your
mind
goes
to
a
bullet
wound
Once
that
image
is
set
in
your
mind
it
can
take
some
work
to
dislodge
it
You
don
t
necessarily
think
space
suit
You
hear
cabin
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
you
think
of
a
small
building
built
of
wood
and
brick
Smoke
out
of
the
chimney
from
a
pleasant
fire
You
don
t
necessarily
think
airplane
Cabin
is
one
of
those
words
that
seemed
unremarkable
to
me
until
I
spent
some
time
thinking
about
it
It
is
a
small
room
a
compartment
but
beyond
that
it
splinters
in
different
directions
A
cabin
is
a
thing
in
the
woods
remote
isolated
a
place
to
escape
to
or
where
one
goes
to
live
simply
It
is
also
a
compartment
on
a
ship
a
private
room
in
a
large
more
complex
vessel
Or
it
is
the
main
body
of
an
airplane
where
all
the
passengers
as
well
as
the
crew
if
it
s
a
small
aircraft
sit
together
The
kind
of
thing
that
you
might
find
strewn
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
Knowing
the
reason
those
two
dead
men
are
in
that
cabin
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
answers
some
questions
but
not
all
It
doesn
t
tell
us
why
the
crash
happened
who
was
responsible
or
anything
about
the
lives
of
these
two
dead
men
The
lateral
thinking
puzzle
is
not
truly
interested
in
these
questions
I
separated
from
my
wife
of
20
years
at
the
end
of
2019
We
had
previously
lived
in
Brooklyn
but
had
moved
upstate
to
Dutchess
County
New
York
for
several
years
when
people
asked
me
why
we
moved
I
often
replied
that
it
was
the
result
of
a
series
of
irrevocable
decisions
There
everything
had
fallen
apart
and
at
the
beginning
of
2020
I
moved
back
to
Brooklyn
to
an
apartment
a
few
blocks
from
where
we
d
lived
together
before
Upstate
we
d
had
a
large
house
and
plenty
of
room
now
I
was
on
the
fifth
floor
of
an
apartment
building
once
again
sharing
walls
I
wanted
very
much
to
focus
on
myself
Now
that
I
was
for
the
first
time
in
decades
not
bound
by
another
person
s
decisions
and
wants
and
happiness
alongside
my
own
I
could
look
inward
and
try
to
understand
what
I
needed
and
what
I
wanted
The
old
me
had
died
I
told
myself
I
could
now
be
whomever
I
wanted
I
made
a
decision
to
live
more
deliberately
to
take
some
control
over
my
life
that
I
felt
had
been
lacking
I
was
going
to
spend
some
time
and
really
focus
on
figuring
out
exactly
what
had
gone
so
wrong
how
things
had
turned
out
so
poorly
But
I
also
decided
to
be
more
open
to
experience
to
consider
possibilities
to
let
myself
be
carried
along
by
the
moment
if
it
meant
new
chances
new
ways
of
being
I
only
had
about
a
month
of
this
before
the
world
came
crashing
to
a
halt
and
I
found
myself
largely
trapped
inside
for
the
next
few
months
Trying
to
merely
stay
alive
I
made
decisions
that
would
have
lasting
impacts
out
of
sheer
reaction
I
saw
my
day-to-day
life
as
from
a
distance
a
sort
of
eerie
remove
as
though
it
was
happening
to
someone
else
I
established
new
patterns
as
a
way
of
asserting
some
kind
of
order
on
the
chaos
and
anxiety
I
felt
then
watched
myself
as
though
someone
else
was
going
through
those
motions
To
be
in
a
cabin
on
a
plane
together
with
your
fellow
passengers
or
to
be
in
a
cabin
on
a
ship
alone
by
yourself
is
to
be
a
passenger
of
some
kind
To
be
in
a
cabin
in
the
woods
is
to
be
going
nowhere
at
all
though
at
least
since
Thoreau
to
be
in
such
a
cabin
is
to
be
on
some
level
on
some
kind
of
introspective
journey
learning
about
yourself
and
how
to
live
I
see
now
that
at
some
point
in
those
early
months
I
began
moving
along
three
separate
timelines
I
was
a
hermit
ensconced
in
a
cabin
trying
to
find
myself
I
was
a
passenger
moving
along
into
the
future
without
agency
and
I
was
alive
amidst
a
wreck
everything
around
me
crashed
everything
broken
There
is
a
specific
cabin
on
the
side
of
a
specific
mountain
that
I
think
about
often
It
is
the
cabin
of
a
McDonnell
Douglas
DC-10-30
Air
New
Zealand
Flight
901
which
sits
on
the
side
of
Mount
Erebus
as
it
has
for
over
40
years
In
1977
Air
New
Zealand
began
operating
sightseeing
tours
over
Antarctica
The
flight
would
leave
Auckland
at
8:00
a.
m.
fly
a
loop
over
the
continent
and
return
to
Christchurch
at
7:00
p.
m.
refuel
and
return
to
Auckland
An
experienced
Arctic
explorer
on
board
would
act
as
a
guide
during
the
trip
pointing
out
landmarks
and
features
of
the
continent
The
approved
flight
plan
involved
flying
directly
over
the
12,448-foot
Mount
Erebus
on
Ross
Island
the
second-highest
peak
in
Antarctica
but
due
to
a
transcription
error
the
actual
flight
path
used
by
most
of
the
sightseeing
flights
involved
flying
down
the
length
of
McMurdo
Sound
some
27
miles
west
of
the
mountain
A
few
days
before
the
accident
another
pilot
noted
this
discrepancy
leading
Air
New
Zealand
to
update
the
flight
plan
albeit
incorrectly
On
November
28
1979
Flight
901
proceeded
along
a
route
that
the
pilot
and
copilot
believed
to
be
along
McMurdo
Sound
descending
to
1,500
feet
Despite
the
crew
being
aware
of
visual
landmarks
all
around
them
they
did
not
realize
that
their
new
path
put
them
on
a
course
to
Mount
Erebus
and
they
did
not
see
the
mountain
directly
in
front
of
them
A
condition
known
as
flat
light
or
sector
whiteout
had
occurred
where
the
mixture
of
snow
on
the
ground
clouds
and
light
conditions
caused
the
pilots
to
lose
depth
of
field
they
were
unable
to
distinguish
the
mountain
from
the
horizon
all
around
them

At
some
point
in
those
final
moments
that
horrifying
trick
of
perspective
revealed
itself
The
empty
white
horizon
was
in
fact
a
mountain
It
was
too
late
to
pull
up
At
12:49
p.
m
the
plane
crashed
into
the
side
of
Mount
Erebus
All
257
people
on
board
were
killed
Because
of
the
expense
and
feasibility
of
a
large-scale
salvage
operation
most
of
the
wreckage
is
still
on
Mount
Erebus
The
bodies
have
been
removed
but
the
cabin
remains
on
the
mountain
Mount
Erebus
is
an
active
volcano
and
one
of
the
more
geologically
important
sites
on
the
planet
It
was
named
by
Sir
James
Clark
Ross
who
named
it
after
his
ship
the
HMS
Erebus
Built
in
1826
the
Erebus
had
begun
its
service
as
a
warship
but
after
two
years
it
was
refitted
for
Arctic
exploration
alongside
the
HMS
Terror
which
had
shelled
Baltimore
during
the
War
of
1812
The
two
ships
left
Tasmania
in
November
of
1840
and
spent
the
winter
exploring
the
island
that
would
later
be
named
for
Ross
the
two
ships
would
make
several
subsequent
expeditions
back
to
Antarctica
in
the
ensuing
years
Then
in
1845
both
ships
were
outfitted
with
steam
engines
and
used
by
Sir
John
Franklin
in
his
doomed
expedition
in
search
of
a
Northwest
Passage
in
the
Canadian
Arctic
Franklin
sailed
in
the
Erebus
in
command
of
the
entire
expedition
while
Francis
Crozier
captained
the
Terror
The
two
ships
were
last
seen
by
Europeans
entering
Baffin
Bay
in
August
of
1845
by
whalers
wherein
they
disappeared
into
the
Canadian
Arctic
The
mystery
captivated
the
British
public
and
multiple
expeditions
were
launched
in
search
of
the
Franklin
Expedition
Eventually
it
became
clear
that
all
129
men
on
board
had
been
lost
Those
men
died
beholden
to
a
fantasy
of
British
imperialism
sleepers
all
sharing
the
same
dream
But
as
the
reality
that
no
one
had
survived
the
Franklin
Expedition
sank
in
among
the
British
populace
it
became
increasingly
important
to
understand
how
they
died
Local
Inuits
who
had
witnessed
the
Franklin
Expedition
reported
that
they
had
descended
into
cannibalism
near
the
end
an
accusation
met
with
widespread
condemnation
tinged
with
racist
vitriol
Charles
Dickens
accused
the
Inuits
of
having
murdered
the
sailors
themselves
We
believe
every
savage
to
be
in
his
heart
covetous
treacherous
and
cruel
he
wrote
Britons
refused
to
believe
that
these
men
bereft
starving
lost
and
hopeless
could
behave
as
anything
but
stalwart
embodiments
of
British
ideals
It
was
important
that
the
people
of
England
be
able
to
tell
themselves
that
these
men
had
died
well
To
believe
in
this
neat
and
tidy
fiction
it
seemed
was
more
important
than
any
reality
that
they
had
died
well
meant
that
the
expedition
wasn
t
a
total
loss
that
there
was
still
something
that
could
be
learned
from
it
about
stoicism
in
the
face
of
despair
heroism
in
the
face
of
defeat
The
truth
was
far
less
important
than
the
lesson
As
for
the
doomed
Flight
901
investigations
would
later
suggest
that
the
pilot
and
copilot
of
Flight
901
were
not
entirely
in
command
The
original
accident
report
cited
pilot
error
as
the
cause
of
the
crash
blaming
the
pilot
s
decision
to
descend
below
the
customary
minimum
altitude
and
his
willingness
to
continue
at
that
altitude
after
it
became
clear
that
the
crew
wasn
t
entirely
sure
of
their
position
But
a
subsequent
inquiry
by
Justice
Peter
Mahon
cleared
the
crew
of
blame
and
instead
blamed
Air
New
Zealand
for
altering
the
flight
plan
without
advising
the
crew
This
second
report
also
blamed
the
whiteout
conditions
what
Mahon
termed
a
malevolent
trick
of
polar
light
Mahon
also
accused
the
airline
of
a
conspiracy
to
whitewash
the
inquiry
he
charged
it
concealed
evidence
and
lied
to
investigators
This
conspiracy
accusation
was
subsequently
dismissed
by
New
Zealand
s
Privy
Council
but
it
still
seems
fair
to
say
that
the
pilot
and
copilot
of
Flight
901
were
not
entirely
in
charge
of
what
happened
that
day
constrained
as
they
were
by
faulty
information
flight
plans
data
and
computers
to
say
nothing
of
the
weather
all
of
which
conspired
to
prevent
them
from
fully
understanding
what
was
happening
as
they
flew
into
the
Antarctic
wilderness
Most
importantly
the
inquiry
failed
to
ascertain
how
the
crew
and
passengers
of
Flight
901
died
it
attempted
to
provide
a
narrative
one
that
could
perhaps
lead
to
some
kind
of
closure
instead
what
it
found
were
contradictions
lies
and
ambiguity
In
those
early
months
of
the
pandemic
one
of
the
few
things
I
learned
was
how
a
single
life
can
split
into
a
series
of
paths
simultaneously
There
were
times
I
felt
absolutely
in
control
and
times
like
I
was
swimming
through
an
endless
chaos
I
remained
in
my
tiny
cabin
of
an
apartment
while
I
hurtled
through
space
both
in
and
out
of
control
at
once
I
learned
that
there
is
not
a
single
narrative
that
at
some
point
in
your
life
your
story
can
splinter
and
divide
and
run
in
parallel
tracks
Elements
from
one
of
your
stories
can
affect
all
the
others
At
some
point
you
hope
these
tracks
will
combine
again
Often
this
can
take
years
Often
it
never
happens
at
all
The
lateral
thinking
puzzle
on
the
other
hand
only
works
if
there
is
a
single
solution
The
cabin
is
an
airplane
cabin
it
is
nothing
else
If
it
is
this
then
the
solution
is
evident
If
it
is
not
then
the
question
how
did
these
men
die
becomes
more
urgent
Bear
attack
Starvation
Cabin
fever
We
don
t
know
can
not
know
As
we
sped
into
the
unknown
in
those
early
days
all
we
wanted
to
know
was
who
was
spared
and
for
how
long
Who
died
and
how
did
they
die
We
knew
there
was
a
disease
but
we
didn
t
understand
how
it
worked
We
knew
there
were
precautions
that
could
keep
you
safe
but
we
didn
t
know
which
ones
worked
and
why
some
people
who
followed
them
still
got
sick
Lives
were
wasted
and
lost
less
because
of
the
disease
itself
and
more
because
of
a
fealty
to
a
broken
set
of
ideas
a
belief
in
a
certain
way
the
world
worked
that
could
not
be
altered
That
the
economy
should
be
our
primary
concern
that
businesses
should
stay
open
at
all
costs
That
it
wasn
t
the
government
s
job
to
intervene
That
personal
choice
was
more
valid
than
collective
action
That
change
was
not
required
And
tens
of
thousands
of
people
were
carried
along
to
their
graves
in
service
of
these
beliefs
You
come
outside
your
Brooklyn
apartment
one
morning
in
April
2020
and
the
entire
street
is
roped
off
in
police
tape
Across
the
street
from
your
front
door
there
is
a
woman
s
body
in
the
trash
How
did
she
die
April
2020
is
when
everything
seemed
to
have
crashed
when
there
was
nothing
but
wreckage
Through
the
middle
of
March
I
had
watched
warily
at
the
unfolding
news
still
trying
to
cling
to
some
measure
of
hope
by
the
end
of
March
the
reality
had
begun
to
set
in
and
everything
seemed
strange
and
emptied
It
began
a
period
when
I
literally
could
not
imagine
life
beyond
the
next
two
weeks
I
couldn
t
see
ahead
in
my
life
as
though
I
had
entered
a
fog
that
obscured
the
future
entirely
By
April
there
was
nothing
but
the
monotony
of
days
the
litany
of
body
counts
and
infection
rates
and
whatever
grim
rituals
could
be
done
to
ward
off
despair
and
hopelessness
And
then
on
a
bright
spring
Wednesday
morning
I
came
outside
to
find
that
a
body
had
been
discovered
across
the
street
a
woman
who
d
been
wrapped
in
a
black
and
white
tarp
and
left
in
a
pile
of
trash
The
cops
were
still
on
the
street
and
I
approached
the
one
wearing
a
mask
speaking
loudly
so
he
didn
t
have
to
get
close
When
I
asked
him
what
happened
he
replied
They
re
doing
an
investigation
Did
someone
die
I
asked
him
Honestly
he
replied
the
news
knows
more
about
it
than
I
do
It
ll
be
on
the
news
It
seemed
to
be
his
job
not
to
know
anything
to
studiously
avoid
knowing
anything
Can
you
tell
me
anything
Should
I
be
worried
I
asked
him
He
repeated
the
line
They
just
have
to
do
an
investigation
Behind
my
question
was
not
merely
idle
curiosity
it
was
of
utmost
importance
at
the
time
to
know
how
people
were
dying
Was
this
a
homicide
Was
I
at
risk
for
my
safety
Did
I
need
to
change
my
patterns
of
behavior
when
I
was
outside
avoid
certain
street
corners
or
neighborhoods
or
times
of
night
Was
it
a
COVID
death
Had
the
outbreak
spread
so
far
and
wide
that
people
were
just
simply
giving
up
dumping
bodies
willy-nilly
Was
this
body
a
harbinger
of
a
complete
breakdown
in
the
city
I
walked
a
bit
away
out
of
earshot
from
the
first
cop
and
put
the
same
question
to
another
cop
It
s
just
that
it
s
suspicious
is
all
he
told
me
So
they
have
to
do
an
investigation
There
was
I
m
sure
a
low
note
of
panic
in
my
voice
But
what
was
it
Someone
was
murdered
Was
it
homicide
It
s
just
suspicious
is
all
he
would
say
Neither
officer
was
willing
to
even
state
the
basic
fact
that
I
already
knew
Neither
was
willing
to
name
the
antecedent
to
that
pronoun
it
The
death
itself
Neither
would
even
cop
to
the
basic
fact
that
there
was
a
body
A
few
days
later
I
learned
from
the
news
that
it
had
not
been
a
homicide
nor
had
it
been
related
to
COVID-19
The
woman
was
believed
to
have
overdosed
and
the
man
she
was
with
had
panicked
dumping
her
body
rather
than
calling
the
paramedics
This
man
was
later
charged
with
concealment
of
a
corpse
a
law
passed
in
New
York
in
2015
referred
to
as
Amanda
Lynn
s
Law
after
Amanda
Lynn
Wienckowski
a
20-year-old
woman
who
was
found
dead
in
the
trash
in
Buffalo
in
2009
Wienckowski
s
death
had
also
been
ruled
an
overdose
but
a
private
autopsy
paid
for
by
the
family
concluded
that
she
had
been
strangled
leaving
unresolved
the
question
of
how
she
died
After
that
the
story
dropped
out
of
the
news
Having
the
solution
to
the
puzzle
solved
nothing
for
me
It
was
on
a
brutal
level
of
reality
the
best
case
scenario
for
discovering
a
body
in
the
trash
It
wasn
t
a
homicide
and
it
wasn
t
related
to
the
ongoing
pandemic
at
least
not
explicitly
so
The
fact
that
it
was
neither
meant
that
my
personal
safety
wasn
t
any
more
or
less
impacted
by
this
gruesome
discovery
And
yet
very
little
changed
for
me
I
wasn
t
reassured
Knowing
the
cause
of
death
changed
nothing
Could
she
have
been
saved
Did
he
try
to
save
her
Why
was
she
there
Was
it
all
a
terrible
accident
Did
she
want
to
die
Why
did
he
panic
Why
couldn
t
he
have
tried
harder
How
did
she
die
My
own
life
went
on
I
tried
not
to
think
about
her
that
body
in
the
trash
that
woman
whose
name
was
never
revealed
But
she
remains
there
carried
with
me
nameless
but
insisting
I
still
pass
the
spot
where
her
body
was
found
several
times
a
day
There
is
no
memorial
there
nothing
to
commemorate
what
happened
you
d
have
to
have
been
there
at
the
time
to
know
it
happened
at
all
My
street
is
filled
with
ghosts
There
are
memorials
for
others
up
and
down
the
block
piles
of
candles
and
fading
flowers
graffitied
RIPs
on
the
sides
of
buildings
laminated
sheets
of
paper
with
smiling
faces
above
dates
tacked
to
trees
So
many
ways
to
be
confronted
with
the
same
questions
Who
was
saved
and
who
was
doomed
and
how
did
they
die
For
the
families
and
sometimes
the
police
there
is
nothing
academic
about
these
questions
they
need
to
be
answered
one
way
or
another
But
what
about
for
the
rest
of
us
the
bystanders
who
know
a
death
has
happened
but
aren
t
involved
directly
We
who
are
too
far
removed
personally
to
ever
know
the
story
but
also
too
close
in
physical
proximity
to
ever
forget
that
something
has
happened
To
live
in
a
city
like
New
York
during
a
catastrophe
is
to
be
reminded
a
hundred
times
that
you
will
never
know
the
answer
to
these
riddles
that
the
work
of
living
through
such
times
is
to
carry
these
unanswered
questions
with
you
to
never
dismiss
them
Sometimes
the
work
we
do
for
the
dead
involves
fighting
for
justice
Sometimes
it
involves
remembrances
and
testimonials
and
obituaries
Sometimes
it
involves
asking
questions
that
you
can
not
answer
Our
obligation
to
the
proximate
dead
is
both
very
little
and
more
than
we
can
possibly
hope
to
achieve
we
ask
the
questions
knowing
there
are
no
permanent
or
stable
answers
only
the
questions
themselves
and
the
endless
attempts
to
answer
them
The
term
lateral
thinking
was
first
coined
by
Edward
de
Bono
in
1967
where
he
argued
that
the
key
was
the
switch
from
familiar
patterns
of
thinking
to
different
and
unexpected
perspectives
allowing
for
new
insight
Rather
than
using
critical
faculties
reasoning
out
the
true
value
of
statements
and
attempting
to
understand
and
correct
errors
lateral
thinking
is
designed
to
radically
break
one
out
of
established
patterns
and
broaden
one
s
tools
for
problem
solving
De
Bono
published
multiple

companies
lateral
thinking
is
a
buzzword
and
a
magic
trick
obfuscating
the
stubborn
work
of
thought
behind
ersatz
epiphanies
Lateral
thinking
presents
itself
as
finding
a
novel
solution
you
reframe
your
perspective
and
you
see
it
there
it
is
The
proper
way
to
go
But
sometimes
there
is
no
proper
way
to
go
there
is
no
trick
of
perspective
that
makes
everything
clear
I
imagined
in
those
early
days
and
in
the
many
many
days
since
that
if
I
spent
enough
time
looking
at
what
had
happened
to
my
life
if
I
turned
around
the
question
in
my
mind
long
enough
the
answer
would
come
clear
and
a
simple
solution
would
present
itself
But
I
have
never
found
this
to
be
the
case
When
I
teach
beginning
students
how
to
write
a
personal
essay
I
usually
tell
them
there
is
a
standard
structure
they
can
follow
There
is
a
past
self
the
one
who
experiences
the
events
in
question
and
a
current
self
the
one
writing
about
these
experiences
afterward
The
essay
is
a
dialogue
I
tell
them
and
it
is
built
around
the
difference
between
these
two
selves
The
current
self
has
learned
something
understands
something
and
is
communicating
that
takeaway
to
the
reader
The
essay
tries
to
answer
the
question
How
did
you
live
You
went
through
something
you
were
changed
in
some
way
you
came
out
the
other
side
How
did
you
do
it
What
did
you
learn
The
perspective
the
reframing
has
happened
and
now
the
writer
sees
clearly
What
was
ambiguous
or
uncertain
is
now
resolved
It
s
a
neat
structure
and
makes
for
a
satisfying
read
but
most
of
the
time
it
s
a
trick
You
write
a
triumphant
essay
about
getting
over
an
ex
and
you
re
still
thinking
about
them
months
later
You
write
about
meeting
the
love
of
your
life
and
by
the
time
the
essay
is
published
you
ve
broken
it
off
with
them
You
write
an
essay
about
what
you
ve
learned
about
yourself
and
you
re
the
same
enigma
the
next
day
I
ve
always
distrusted
the
form
of
the
personal
essay
because
I
recognize
the
lie
here
recognize
how
easy
it
is
to
put
together
a
satisfying
narrative
conclusion
about
an
incident
in
my
life
one
that
delivers
on
a
certain
promise
made
to
the
reader
a
satisfaction
entirely
built
on
smoke
These
neat
pat
resolutions
at
best
can
only
describe
one
facet
of
one
s
life
at
one
particular
moment
Meanwhile
the
rest
of
you
these
parallel
lives
remain
messy
untidy
ambiguous
complicated
Enough
time
has
passed
since
those
early
days
of
2020
and
I
ve
spent
more
than
enough
time
thinking
and
puzzling
on
them
that
by
now
I
assume
I
should
know
something
I
should
be
able
to
offer
a
takeaway
of
some
kind
What
those
days
meant
to
me
What
I
see
now
that
I
couldn
t
see
then
How
I
was
changed
How
I
was
saved
How
I
lived
But
none
of
this
is
true
All
that
I
find
I
can
do
is
keep
adding
new
layers
to
the
same
question
one
on
top
of
each
other
The
only
thing
that
feels
true
about
myself
is
the
series
of
questions
I
m
constantly
asking
myself
that
never
get
answered
fully
but
get
asked
again
and
again
in
an
ever-evolving
light
How
did
they
die
How
did
I
live
The
mountain
reveals
itself
and
the
plane
crashes
The
ship
reaches
its
destination
and
the
passenger
disembarks
The
hermit
enmeshed
in
solitude
for
long
enough
has
an
epiphany
The
inquiry
is
finished
the
cause
of
death
announced
The
pandemic
winds
down
The
essay
reaches
its
conclusion
You
think
that
something
has
ended
here
but
it
s
just
a
trick
of
perspective

Countless
philosophers
have
posited
that
what
we
keep
determines
what
we
remember
The
material
we
deliberately
preserve
provides
insight
into
what
we
value
and
what
we
expect
to
value
in
an
unknowable
future
This
raises
the
question
Why
do
we
keep
what
we
keep
Who
decides
And
how
does
what
we
keep
affect
what
we
collectively
remember
in
practice
If
what
we
collect
determines
what
we
remember
we
have
to
be
mindful
about
what
we
re
willing
to
lose
These
are
questions
I
consider
regularly
as
an
archivist
This
is
a
collection
of
articles
about
the
objects
and
the
people
collecting
and
interpreting
them
which
constitute
our
shared
material
heritage
Archive
is
loosely
defined
here
Some
of
these
are
formal
institutional
archives
while
others
are
public
Flickr
albums
or
simple
websites
maintained
by
a
single
person
But
all
of
them
are
in
some
way
lost
or
inaccessible
What
we
let
slip
away
is
just
as
instructive
as
what
we
labor
to
collect
Appraisal
is
the
process
by
which
archivists
decide
if
an
item
or
a
collection
fits
into
their
repository
s
collection
Many
factors
go
into
this
but
one
of
them
is
whether
the
material
in
question
is
archival
at
all
is
it
rare
or
even
unique
And
if
so
is
it
original
There
s
a
lot
wrapped
up
in
the
mystique
of
the
original
but
in
this
article
Jody
Rosen
offers
some
exceptionally
practical
reasons
that
originals
are
valuable
Investigating
the
2008
Universal
Studios
fire
which
destroyed
tens
of
thousands
of
music
masters
Rosen
s
article
examines
how
this
loss
was
also
a
destruction
of
our
shared
culture
The
result
is
a
crisis
a
slow-motion
assault
on
our
musical
heritage
that
is
poorly
understood
by
many
within
the
record
industry
to
say
nothing
of
the
public
at
large
Had
a
loss
of
comparable
magnitude
to
the
Universal
fire
occurred
at
a
different
cultural
institution
say
the
Metropolitan
Museum
of
Art
there
might
have
been
wider
awareness
of
the
event
perhaps
some
form
of
accountability
Yet
the
conservation
mission
faced
by
record
labels
may
be
no
less
vital
than
those
of
museums
and
libraries
Recorded
music
is
arguably
America
s
great
artistic
patrimony
our
supreme
gift
to
world
culture
How
should
it
be
safeguarded
And
by
whom
Scent
is
a
fundamental
element
of
our
environments
It
may
seem
impossible
to
archive
but
Miguel
Trancozo
Travino
explores
projects
that
are
attempting
to
do
it
One
graduate
student
is
attempting
to
create
an
archive
of
scents
for
instance
while
a
researcher
and
visual
artist
is
creating
smellmaps
which
interpret
the
scents
of
a
landscape
As
these
projects
demonstrate
it
s
very
possible
to
break
scents
down
and
record
their
component
elements
The
challenge
lies
in
also
capturing
the
human
element
or
what
a
scent
means
in
context
There
is
a
long-standing
framework
for
preserving
intangible
cultural
heritage
and
researchers
and
artists
working
on
scent
projects
argue
that
they
are
doing
just
that
But
why
does
a
town
s
smell
matter
What
valuable
information
is
written
into
the
odour
of
a
city
street
or
building
It
runs
a
lot
deeper
than
just
preserving
a
scent
for
its
novelty
says
Alex
Rhys-Taylor
of
Goldsmiths
University
who
specialises
in
the
multisensory
experience
of
urban
space
I
would
say
through
my
research
that
you
can
learn
a
lot
about
a
city
s
economy
a
lot
about
its
culture
through
the
sense
of
smell
Jesse
Dorris
prompts
us
to
consider
the
why
and
how
behind
the
material
that
never
ends
up
in
an
archive
at
all
The
history
of
archiving
from
ordinary
people
is
mixed
at
best
and
further
complicated
when
the
ordinary
people
in
question
are
perceived
as
deviant
Records
from
marginalized
groups
are
often
collected
by
community
archives
which
are
typically
under-resourced
compared
to
their
more
established
counterparts
Sites
like
eBay
are
treasure
troves
for
those
records
that
may
not
be
collected
by
traditional
institutional
archives
That
means
though
that
key
historical
material
is
vulnerable
to
the
whims
of
a
major
corporation
This
was
put
in
stark
relief
when
eBay
banned
the
sale
of
sexually
oriented
materials
much
of
which
was
queer
books
periodicals
photographs
and
more
Dorris
focuses
on
queer
leather
and
kink
publications
but
the
archival
exclusion
he
discusses
is
true
of
many
queer
publications
whether
they
contain
sexual
content
or
are
sexualized
by
virtue
of
being
queer
As
Dorris
points
out
the
history
at
stake
is
of
interest
to
more
than
just
archivists
and
historians
curators
filmmakers
and
other
cultural
workers
draw
from
eBay
as
well
as
do
queer
people
trying
to
salvage
their
own
historical
legacies
As
marginalized
communities
become
more
assimilated
into
the
mainstream
Johnson
s
archive
stands
as
proof
of
who
did
it
what
was
done
and
who
was
there
But
no
one
knows
how
much
more
of
this
history
remains
to
be
discovered
and
preserved
My
biggest
fear
Purchell
said
is
that
people
who
come
into
possession
of
this
material
will
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
They
won
t
think
it
has
value
And
they
ll
throw
it
in
the
trash

is

investigation
by
Erica
X
Eisen
of
killed
photographs
from
the
U.
S
Farm
Security
Administration
s
attempt
to
document
the
Great
Depression
Killed
photographs
were
meant
to
be
excluded
from
the
collection
and
demarcated
with
a
merciless
hole
punch
through
the
middle
Photographs
were
killed
at
the
discretion
of
the
project
s
head
Roy
Emerson
Stryker
and
it
seems
that
most
of
the
ones
destroyed
were
redundancies
of
some
sort
That
said
a
number
of
his
colleagues
and
photographers
felt
that
he
killed
with
a
little
too
much
abandon
Eisen
examines
what
was
lost
when
the
photographs
were
killed
and
what
we
learn
from
the
hole-punched
pictures
Archival
material
doesn
t
just
tell
the
story
of
what
it
is
representing
In
other
words
the
FSA
photographs
provide
historical
clues
about
their
subjects
but
the
objects
themselves
have
a
history
as
well
The
visible
efforts
to
obscure
the
objects
add
another
layer
to
their
history
one
that
is
legible
In
the
killed
negatives
we
find
Barthes
dictum
literalized
it
is
the
little
hole
or
holes
themselves
that
arrest
our
eyes
and
imagination
The
strange
contradiction
at
the
heart
of
the
killed
negatives
as
the
very
existence
of
this
essay
attests
is
that
in
an
important
sense
they
weren
t
killed
the
hole-punched
photos
remain
in
the
Library
of
Congress
preserved
by
Stryker
himself
and
the
Pittsburgh
Photography
Library
images
deemed
unfit
for
the
archives
have
instead
come
to
comprise
their
own
separate
archive
in
the
same
building
a
sort
of
Salon
des
Refusés
…
In
the
subtle
but
unmistakable
way
that
Stryker
s
puncture
marks
reveal
the
three-dimensional
negative
from
which
each
two-dimensional
image
is
printed
they
call
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
photograph
is
a
physical
object
and
a
fragile
one
at
that
Archives
and
power
especially
state
power
have
a
complex
reciprocal
relationship
Narayani
Basu
explores
the
challenges
of
doing
research
at
the
National
Archives
of
India
where
these
two
topics
collide
These
challenges
byzantine
catalogs
an
inscrutable
internal
language
a
lack
of
access
to
materials
impact
historians
along
with
anyone
whose
field
benefits
from
an
understanding
of
the
past
This
highlights
the
fact
that
those
who
hold
archives
and
by
extension
knowledge
also
hold
power
State
actors
can
wield
this
power
in
part
by
controlling
who
can
access
knowledge
This
is
by
no
means
limited
to
India
for
instance
the
National
Archives
and
Records
Administration
in
the
United
States
was
set
to
close
and
sell
the
National
Archives
at
Seattle
until
a
successful
grassroots
campaign
reversed
the
decision
If
the
sale
had
gone
through
it
would
have
been
a
double
whammy
of
sorts
because
the
National
Archives
at
Seattle
contains
records
transferred
from
the
National
Archives
at
Anchorage
when
that
institution
was
shut
down
in
2016
Uninhibited
access
to
archives
is
and
should
be
an
essential
characteristic
of
a
democracy
There
is
much
to
glean
from
the
study
of
the
past
I
say
this
not
just
with
regard
to
history
but
to
politics
law
society
culture
economy
and
science
Researchers
who
use
an
archive
are
usually
from
varied
academic
backgrounds
In
itself
this
brings
a
considerable
nuance
to
an
archive
of
pluralism
and
diversity
of
interests
The
records
of
past
choices
are
proof
of
the
fact
that
every
decision
has
a
consequence
Citizens
of
a
democratic
society
hold
the
right
to
understand
their
past
as
well
as
the
right
to
learn
truths
governments
may
find
uncomfortable
or
contentious
In
this
sense
an
archive
holds
a
government
and
society
accountable
It
helps
a
people
understand
the
motivations
of
previous
public
officials
and
the
workings
of
older
regimes
In
its
best
form
then
a
nation
s
archive
is
much
more
than
a
keeper
of
its
records
and
memories
It
is
a
living
testament
to
the
many
facets
of
national
identity
and
history
Dayna
Evans
tells
the
story
of
a
remarkable
project
by
New
Jersey
librarian
Lynne
Olver
For
decades
Olver
single-handedly
built
the
largest
resource
on
food
history
on
the
internet
in
direct
response
to
the
topics
admirers
asked
her
to
research
over
the
decades
This
is
a
story
about
what
access
to
historical
materials
looks
like
It
is
one
thing
to
amass
a
personal
library
of
2,300
books
going
back
to
the
17th
century
it
s
entirely
another
to
make
that
information
public
legible
and
useful
Evans
explores
the
impact
that
the
Food
Timeline
had
on
its
users
from
podcast
hosts
to
home
cooks
This
is
also
a
story
about
how
precarious
and
unsustainable
these
undertakings
often
are
After
Olver
passed
away
in
2015
her
family
struggled
to
find
somebody
to
maintain
the
Food
Timeline
That
is
where
the
Eater
story
ends
Never
fear
though
the
project
ended
up
finding
a
home
at
Virginia
Tech
University
Libraries
When
you
look
past
the
Times

and

the

happens
to
be

For
the
first
time
a
pandemic
has
triggered
institutional
plans
for
rapid-response
collecting
an
initiative
pioneered
by
London

The

the
sheer
prevalence
of

rot
suggests
otherwise
Unless
websites
are
actively
archived
they
are
subject
to
be

forever
However
web
archiving
is
a
complicated
and
expensive
undertaking
even
with
the
presence
of
major
projects
like
the
Internet
Archive
a
critical
mass
of

Adrienne
LaFrance
details
how
access
to

is
in
some
ways
knowledge
itself
and
how
much
is
at
stake
when
we
misunderstand
the
internet
as
a

entity
The
promise
of
the

is
that
Alexandria
s

might
be

for

But
today
s
great

is
being
destroyed
even
as
it
is
being
built
Until
you
lose
something
big
on
the
Internet
something
truly
valuable
this
paradox
can
be
difficult
to
understand
How
do
you
archive
a
landscape
Architectural
historians
and
others
interested
in
the
built
environment
must
rely
on
representations
of
their
object
of
study
As
Kate
Wagner
explains
the
built
environment
around
us
changes
more
quickly
than
we
may
expect
Who
is
saving
records
of
ordinary
buildings
the
ones
where
average
people
live
their
lives
As
it
turns
out
at
least
in
the
case
of
America
s
vanishing
Kmart
it
s
Flickr
users
This
is
the
ice-cold
reality
of
the
retail
death
spiral
It
s
why
people
feel
the
need
to
collect
motel
postcards
share
old
photos
of
their
hometowns
and
document
the
finale
of
Kmart
The
end
time
is
always
lurking
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
take
pictures
and
post
stories
before
it
happens
There
is
no
alternative
there
is
no
saving
your
childhood
home
after
it
s
caught
in
the
crosshairs
of
the
developer
there
is
no
salvaging
the
hotel
ballroom
where
you
held
your
wedding
reception
there
is
no
rescuing
the
Sears
where
you
worked
your
first
job
These
photographs
and
stories
are
not
celebrations
of
great
architecture
but
they
are
an
epilogue
born
of
existing
and
preemptive
grief
for
beloved
objects
and
spaces
ground
up
in
the
gears
of
money
and
progress
For
these
populist
archivists
the
project
would
not
be
so
urgent
if
there
were
a
scintilla
of
hope
for
a
future
without
the
ceaseless
inevitable
ruination
of
so
many
landscapes
buildings
and
cultural
artifacts

The
big
yellow
machine
casts
up
a
brown
blizzard
of
dust
adding
to
the
trouble
of
seeing
any
small
bodies
attempting
to
run
or
slither
for
their
lives
I
chase
the
fleeing
field
mice
and
pocket
gophers
pinching
them
at
the
backs
of
their
necks
and
stuff
them
into
the
pocket
of
my
orange
safety
vest
already
bulging
with
the
wriggling
bodies
of
alligator
lizards
and
western
skinks
Better
that
pocket
than
the
other
where
a
two-foot
gopher
snake
is
coiled
up
its
head
poking
out
from
this
alien
world
of
fluorescent
orange
where
it
slowly
unspools
its
slender
body
the
color
of
wet
hay
up
my
torso
Again
and
again
I
coax
it
back
in
using
the
heel
of
my
palm
waiting
for
the
mayhem
to
cease
long
enough
to
walk
across
the
busy
road
to
the
edge
of
a
dry
creek
bed
where
I
unceremoniously
dump
them
all
in
a
squirming
pile
below
a
blackberry
thicket
Homeless
but
alive
To
the
rest
of
the
construction
crew
I
must
look
ridiculous
stooped
over
racing
this
way
and
that
through
a
cloud
of
dust
filling
my
pockets
with
small
creatures
as
the
rotary
mixer
nips
at
my
heels
But
I
ve
learned
not
to
care
No
matter
how
I
appear
the
biologist
will
always
be
the
outcast
on
these
projects
When
I
walk
away
from
the
machine
I
can
t
tell
where
the
dust
ends
and
the
smoke
begins
Once
again
the
air
in
California
is
lethal
to
breathe
bruised
gray
and
purple
burning
my
eyes
and
throat
as
I
stand
in
it
day
after
day
But
this
year
is
different
this
year
I
need
two
separate
masks
to
juggle
two
separate
calamities
When
alone
the
N95
with
a
one-way
valve
is
superior
for
filtering
smoke
but
when
close
to
others
I
quickly
switch
to
my
cloth
mask
for
the
virus
knowing
the
valve
won
t
protect
them
from
my
potentially
deadly
exhalations
It
s
late
summer
2020
and
we
re
all
still
beginners
at
learning
to
live
with
an
invisible
killer
Some
animals
don
t
flee
when
the
mixer
comes
They
hold
their
ground
Wait
for
the
trouble
to
pass
But
nothing
in
their
evolution
has
prepared
them
for
an
eight-foot-wide
drum
covered
in
corkscrewing
blades
coming
straight
towards
their
soft
bodies
where
they
hunker
in
their
meadow
homes
The
rotary
mixer
penetrates
the
ground
20
inches
deep
turning
the
hard-packed
earth
into
fluffy
aerated
hydrated
soil
in
tidy
rows
It
s
a
dream
machine
if
you
need
to
turn
a
lumpy
field
into
the
future
site
of
a
housing
development
but
it
s
a
science-fiction
nightmare
if
you
re
a
vole
or
a
praying
mantis
or
a
king
snake
a
slender
salamander
an
earthworm
a
deer
mouse
or
a
Jerusalem
cricket
The
ones
who
don
t
flee
will
be
ground
into
sausage
and
mixed
evenly
into
the
soil
and
sometimes
are
so
pulverized
they
become
more
mist
than
matter
Within
an
hour
of
the
first
pass
of
the
mixer
crows
appear
by
the
dozens
to
peck
at
the
peppered
bits
of
the
animals
I
failed
to
save
My
job
is
not
to

any
of

Before
European
settlers
colonized
this
area
one
could
scarcely
come
up
with
a
place
more
perfectly
suited
to
the
unique
needs
of
tiger
salamanders
than
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
a
lush
mosaic
of
lakes
creeks
wetlands
vernal
pools
riparian
forests
grasslands
and
oak
savannah
A
hummocky
world
of
wet
depressions
and
dry
rises
as
if
the
land
itself
was
as
amphibious
as
the
salamanders
who
thrived
there
Tiger
salamanders
live
a
double
life
they
need
both
wet
and
dry
places
in
close
proximity
For
most
of
the
year
they
stay
underground
in
the
burrows
of
other
animals
or
in
large
cracks
in
the
adobe
soil
But
when
the
rains
come
they
emerge
from
their
subterranean
lairs
to
migrate
in
their
slow
salamandery
way
padding
out
across
the
land
to
a
nearby
breeding
pond
which
must
be
ephemeral
to
ensure
no
predatory
fish
can
take
up
residence
in
them
After
breeding
the
adults
move
upland
again
leaving
their
eggs
to
hatch
into
larvae
who
metamorphose
either
quickly
or
slowly
depending
on
the
speed
at
which
their
pool
is
drying
up
Once
the
larvae
grow
legs
maturing
into
juveniles
who
breathe
air
through
lungs
instead
of
gills
they
too
migrate
upland
to
find
an
underground
home
where
they
remain
for
the
two
to
five
years
it
will
take
them
to
reach
breeding
age
I
thought
a
lot
about
tiger
salamanders
during
the
early
weeks
of
the
pandemic
drawing
inspiration
from
these
masters
of
sheltering-in-place
I
live
in
a
trailer
which
normally
suits
me
just
fine
I
find
small
spaces
comforting
and
too
many
possessions
stressful
so
the
trailer
offers
the
perfect
constraint
But
when
shelter-in-place
began
in
March
my
trailer
quickly
shrank
around
me
I
morphed
into
a
subterranean
animal
living
in
a
narrow
aluminum
burrow
aestivating
during
the
dry
months
waiting
for
rain
Waiting
for
a
vaccine
Waiting
for
anyone
to
tell
me
anything
that
felt
true
or
useful
Time
thickened
then
congealed
I
hunched
over
shuffling
around
in
my
sweatpants
One
step
to
the
fridge
two
to
the
bathroom
one
to
the
bed
three
to
the
door
This
trailer
was
only
meant
to
be
a
home
base
for
my
life
on
the
move
as
a
field
biologist
A
way
to
hack
the
Bay
Area
s
obscene
rental
market
one
of
the
highest
in
the
nation
Not
a
place
to
weather
a
global
pandemic
Alone
After
months
of
being
stuck
inside
treating
my
groceries
like
hazardous
waste
until
I
d
washed
them
with
soap
and
growing
tired
of
my
own
cooking
it
was
tiger
salamanders
who
finally
coaxed
me
out
of
my
burrow
or
at
least
the
possibility
of
them
A
few
months
into
the
pandemic
developers
had
found
their
way
onto
the
essential
worker
s
list
and
I
got
the
call
about
42
new
townhouses
being
built
in
a
vacant
lot
in
Santa
Rosa
The
ones
who
don
t
flee
will
be
ground
into
sausage
and
mixed
evenly
into
the
soil
and
sometimes
are
so
pulverized
they
become
more
mist
than
matter
Vacant
being
a
relative
term
Without
needing
to
see
it
I
knew
the
site
would
be
home
to
many
living
things
And
it
was
The
first
day
on
the
job
I
saw
fence
and
alligator
lizards
a
garter
snake
western
skink
piles
of
fox
shit
many
birds
I
also
found
the
recent
remains
of
a
human
encampment
as
I
always
do
at
the
beginning
of
these
projects
Vacant
according
to
the
company
preparing
to
develop
the
land
meant
the
lot
was
empty
of
any
living
thing
willing
to
pay
money
to
be
there
What
I
didn
t
find
in
that
lot
were
any
tiger
salamanders
And
I
knew
I
wouldn
t
They
re
endangered
for
a
reason
The
needs
of
tiger
salamanders
are
far
too
specific
for
them
to
be
living
in
a
bone-dry
weedy
lot
like
this
penned
in
by
urban
sprawl
and
nowhere
near
a
breeding
pool
long
ago
amputated
from
the
last
life-supporting
places
of
tiger
salamanders
in
Sonoma
County
But
as
the
yellow
machines
stripped
the
land
bare
like
a
swarm
of
gargantuan
locusts
I
spent
day
after
day
looking
for
them
anyway
filling
the
pockets
of
my
safety
vest
with
the
struggling
bodies
of
all
those
we
aren
t
mandated
to
care
about
You
ve
been
out
here
every
day
for
two
weeks
and
still
haven
t
found
one
of
them
salamanders
the
foreman
said
to
me
one
morning
appearing
beside
me
and
slapping
me
on
the
back
while
I
watched
an
excavator
dig
up
a
waterline
Not
yet
I
replied
stepping
away
his
handprint
glowing
on
my
shoulder
blade
like
a
coronavirus
starburst
Then
what
s
the
point
of
having
you
out
here
if
there
aren
t
any
he
asked
me
maskless
Well
there
s
always
a
chance
there
are
I
told
him
despite
knowing
there
almost
certainly
wasn
t
They
used
to
be
all
over
before
we
dried
up
the
Laguna
I
added
He
looked
around
at
this
dusty
flat
unremarkable
place
surrounded
by
houses
a
nearby
high
school
storefronts
with
blinking
neon
signs
busy
roads
I
m
guessing
that
s
all
he
saw
I
m
guessing
he
wasn
t
imagining
what
this
place
used
to
look
like
only
a
few
generations
ago
like
I
was
He
stepped
forward
peering
into
the
eight-foot
trench
There
s
too
much
fucking
clay
in
this
soil
he
barked
saying
it
to
no
one
in
particular
before
walking
away
I
wanted
to
yell
at
him
that
there
s
too
much
fucking
clay
in
this
soil
because
it
used
to
be
a
wetland
There
s
too
much
fucking
clay
in
this
soil
because
this
place
once
teemed
with
profusions
of
wet
aquatic
life
But
I
kept
quiet
staying
in
my
narrow
lane
only
here
for
the
nonexistent
salamanders
Before
Europeans
settled
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
and
turned
it
into
cow
pasture
and
high-intensity
agricultural
land
smearing
it
with
chemicals
and
shopping
centers
bifurcating
it
with
roadways
and
irrigation
canals
before
they
dried
it
up
domesticated
it
and
sucked
the
green
lush
life
from
its
spongy
soil
turning
the
land
and
its
grasses
the
dead-gray
of
roadside
cardboard
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
was
dripping
and
oozing
with
life
sprinting
squirming
squiggling
crawling
flapping
splashing
and
growling
across
its
skies
and
lands
and
waters
Grizzly
bears
were
here
wading
up
to
their
haunches
in
cool
clear
water
never
touched
by
agrochemicals
hormones
antibiotics
or
gasoline
Salmon
pushed
up
rushing
creeks
and
rivers
skipping
over
each
other
s
backs
beating
past
the
swiping
claws
of
the
bears
big
as
catcher
s
mitts
Waterfowl
blackened
the
sky
like
living
billowing
curtains
honking
and
calling
shitting
an
even
coat
of
nutrient-rich
fertilizer
across
every
inch
of
the
land
sending
a
chaos
of
plant
life
bursting
skywards
Pronghorn
grazed
at
the
wetland
s
edges
stalked
by
cougar
slinking
down
through
the
purple
manzanita
of
the
foothills
while
condors
with
nine-foot
wingspans
cast
sharp
slicing
shadows
over
the
land
searching
for
bloat
for
stink
for
blood
of
which
there
was
plenty
At
night
bats
swooped
and
hunted
through
a
thick
sonic
stew
of
frog
chorus
and
coyotes
curdled
the
air
with
their
manic
songs
whenever
the
silver
moon
rose
in
the
east
And
of
course
there
were
people
here
then
too
The
Southern
Pomo
built
tule
balsa
rafts
and
lived
in
tule
huts
all
over
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
fishing
for
salmon
with
hooks
chipped
from
chert
Hunting
black-tailed
deer
and
pronghorn
Gathering
fat
acorns
in
baskets
woven
from
willow
branches
Coexisting
with
all
this
life
And
amidst
the
flurry
the
tiger
salamanders
their
dark
stalky
bodies
splotched
in
archipelagos
of
sunlit
buttercup
as
they
ambushed
spiders
in
the
darkness
of
gopher
burrows
Tiger
salamanders
their
yellow
lips
giving
them
the
appearance
of
a
dopey
grin
twisting
their
wet
rubbery
bodies
around
each
other
in
breeding
ponds
Tiger
salamander
larvae
boiling
in
every
vernal
pool
dotting
the
plain
the
external
lungs
behind
their
heads
swaying
like
aquatic
lion
s
manes
Tiger
salamanders
dragging
their
heavy
tails
as
they
migrate
by
the
thousands
on
the
first
big
rain
of
the
year
a
clumsy
procession
of
yellow
speckles
moving
in
slow
motion
over
hills
through
tall
swaying
grasses
past
the
brown
humped
mountains
of
sleeping
grizzlies
A
few
getting
speared
and
eaten
by
herons
and
egrets
along
the
way
or
batted
in
the
air
by
bobcats
ground
up
by
rapacious
badgers
or
swallowed
whole
by
snakes
But
they
kept
going
determined
to
get
to
their
breeding
ponds
at
any
cost
determined
to
make
more
tiger
salamanders
The
only
ones
in
the
world
who
can
This
was
not
so
long
ago
This
wasn
t
the
Pleistocene
or
some
other
far-flung
time
in
the
past
This
was
less
than
200
years
ago
Individual
koi
fish
have
been
known
to
live
longer
than
that
Only
100
years
ago
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
was
closer
to
that
throng
of
life
than
to
what
it
is
today
traffic
bad
air
car
dealerships
glinting
in
the
sunlight
Townhouses
crammed
between
townhouses
crammed

Vacant
according

preparing
to
develop
the
land
meant
the

was
empty
of
any

willing
to

to

The
reason
tiger
salamanders
are
no
longer
proliferating
as
they
once
did
is
not
for
lack
of
effort
Nowadays
on
the
first
big
rain
of
the
year
they
are
run
over
by
the
dozens
as
they
slowly
cross
busy
roads
separating
their
underground
homes
from
breeding
ponds
drawn
by
the
strength
of
a
giant
magnet
born
of
tens
of
thousands
of
years
of
instinct
Local
biologists
have
learned
where
some
of
the
busier
crossings
tend
to
be
and
will
spend
all
night
standing
in
the
rain
escorting
salamanders
safely
from
one
side
to
the
other
headlights
whipping
past
them
at
70
miles
per
hour
But
these
efforts
are
not
enough
to
counteract
what
we
ve
done
to
the
land
in
Sonoma
County
In
less
than
a
geologic
blink
of
an
eye
95
%
of
the
breeding
habitat
of
the
Sonoma
County
population
of
the
California
tiger
salamander
is
now
gone
or
under
direct
threat
from
development
And
it
isn
t
just
the
salamanders
who
are
suffering
Some
of
the
largest
grizzly
bears
in
the
world
used
to
live
where
I
live
the
last
one
shot
by
white
settlers
in
California
in
1922
Gray
wolves
were
also
trapped
and
shot
into
local
extinction
in
California
though
after
90
years
of
absence
a
small
pack
has
recently
reentered
the
Golden
State
mounting
a
quiet
comeback
godspeed
Pronghorn
a
short-necked
relative
of
the
giraffe
left
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
long
ago
as
did
the
California
condor
after
nearly
going
extinct
due
to
lead
poisoning
from
the
bullets
filling
the
bodies
of
the
countless
animals
left
to
rot
across
the
landscape
According
to
the
historical
records
of
the
Laguna
Foundation
in
Santa
Rosa
an
individual
hunter
killed
6,200
ducks
by
himself
in
1892
to
supply
markets
in
San
Francisco
One
morning
I
noticed
seven
Canada
geese
standing
in
the
center
of
our
project
site
When
the
construction
crew
arrived
firing
up
the
yellow
machines
this
anemic
flock
flew
off
to
look
for
some
other
marginal
place
to
scrape
out
an
existence
As
I
watched
them
fly
away
I
didn
t
see
seven
geese
in
the
sky
above
me
I
saw
the
ghosts
of
the
thousands
of
birds
that
were
no
longer
there
replaced
instead
by
a
sky
toxic
with
smoke
None
of
this
is
normal
yet
we
treat
it
as
if
it
is
And
it
isn
t
just
Northern
California
that
s
changed
the
entire
planet
has
All
the
way
down
to
the
fish
in
the
sea
As
a
species
we
suffer
from
a
sort
of
collective
amnesia
brought
on
by
a
phenomenon
called
shifting
baseline
syndrome
Shifting
baselines
are
what
allow
each
new
generation
of
people
to
be
born
into
a
world
that
appears
normal
to
them
even
as
their
grandparents
loudly
lament
the
way
things
used
to
be
Those
lamentations
die
with
the
older
generation
and
the
new
generation
begins
the
process
over
now
bemoaning
the
changes
they
ve
witnessed
in
their
short
lifetimes
while
their
children
and
grandchildren
are
born
into
worlds
that
appear
perfectly
normal
to
them
And
so
on
A
classic
example
of
shifting
baseline
syndrome
was
discovered
by
marine
biologist
Loren
McClenachan
when
she
found
a
series
of
historic
photographs
all
taken
in
the
same
place
on
a
wharf
in
Key
West
Florida
The
photos
show
people
displaying
their
day
s
fishing
catch
in
front
of
a
hanging
board
throughout
the
decades
beginning
in
1956
up
until
2007
As
the
years
slip
past
the
fish
on
display
get
smaller
and
smaller
and
smaller
At
first
in
the
1950s
they
are
mighty
behemoths
hanging
from
hooks
taller
than
the
people
who
caught
them
averaging
43
8
pounds
But
by
2007
the
average
weight
of
the
fish
is
only
five
pounds
held
proudly
in
the
hands
of
the
anglers
with
no
exertion
whatsoever
Yet
what
is
most
striking
about
these
photographs
isn
t
the
shrinking
fish
but
rather
the
smiles
on
the
faces
of
these
pleased
fisherpeople
which
lose
none
of
their
brightness
throughout
the
decades
even
as
their
catches
become
preposterously
diminished
This
is
shifting
baseline
syndrome
We
keep
smiling
ignorant
to
the
fact
that
the
natural
world
which
we
rely
on
for
survival
is
disappearing
beneath
our
feet
and
in
our
very
hands
Recently
we
ve
reached
a
point
where
the
ecological
changes
are
happening
too
fast
and
are
too
destructive
for
us
to
continue
in
this
ignorance
Shifting
baseline
syndrome
may
have
helped
to
bring
the
Big
Bad
Wolf
to
our
door
but
climate
change
habitat
loss
and
pollution
have
blown
the
house
down
Or
in
the
case
of
my
home
state
of
California
burned
the
house
down
Only
100
years
ago
the
Santa
Rosa
Plain
was
closer
to
that
throng
of
life
than
to
what
it
is
today
traffic
bad
air
car
dealerships
glinting
in
the
sunlight
Townhouses
crammed
between
townhouses
crammed
between
townhouses
Growing
up
in
Northern
California
I
never
remember
the
sky
filling
with
smoke
Not
once
Wildfires
if
I
heard
about
them
at
all
were
burning
over
there
somewhere
out
of
sight
and
nothing
for
me
to
fear
Not
anymore
2020
marked
the
fourth
straight
year
Sonoma
County
was
either
on
fire
itself
or
smothered
by
the
toxic
smoke
of
other
fires
or
both
as
it
became
the
largest
most
destructive
fire
season
in
California
s
history
During
a
day
off
from
looking
for
salamanders
I
found
myself
stuck
in
my
trailer
again
The
air
quality
outside
measured
in
PM2
5
was
in
the
370s
Anything
above
300
is
considered
by
the
EPA
to
be
hazardous
to
human
health
and
anything
above
151
is
categorized
as
unhealthy
The
air
temperature
was
95˚F
I
had
no
choice
but
to
keep
every
window
and
door
sealed
shut
because
of
the
smoke
but
my
trailer
sits
in
direct
sunlight
and
the
indoor
temperature
quickly
outpaced
the
heat
outside
Sweat
poured
down
my
body
as
if
in
a
sauna
at
full
furnace
My
chest
tightened
I
felt
squeezed
by
the
hands
of
some
invisible
giant
I
couldn
t
tell
if
it
was
claustrophobia
or
if
I
was
actually
running
out
of
breathable
air
I
paced
around
my
narrow
home
leaving
wet
footprints
across
the
wood
floors
the
air
a
hot
toxic
porridge
both
inside
and
out
Panicked
I
went
to
the
window
looking
out
across
the
farm
where
my
trailer
is
parked
Normally
I
see
green
hills
and
old
red
barns
out
that
window
but
on
this
day
I
could
barely
see
the
outline
of
my
truck
parked
only
15
away
a
vague
shape
in
a
brown-gray
hellscape
My
chest
squeezed
tighter
I
had
to
find
some
good
air
to
breathe
I
held
the
door
handle
ready
to
burst
out
of
this
sweltering
aluminum
pillbox
but
there
was
nowhere
to
go
I
was
trapped
If
I
opened
the
door
the
air
inside
my
trailer
would
only
get
worse
This
wasn
t
simply
the
smoke
of
charred
forests
but
countless
human
structures
as
well
filled
with
paint
asbestos
burned-out
cars
garages
full
of
half-empty
gas
cans
lacquers
engine
oil
cleaning
supplies
I
remembered
two
years
earlier
when
the
smoke
from
the
fire
that
destroyed
the
entire
town
of
Paradise
settled
over
Sonoma
County
and
I
d
wondered
if
I
was
breathing
dead
bodies
If
the
ash
on
my
truck
was
someone
s
uncle
or
mother
Black
bear
or
rattlesnake
I
fell
face-first
onto
my
small
couch
pressing
my
nose
and
mouth
into
a
pillow
trying
to
calm
down
I
thought
of
the
salamanders
how
they
breathe
air
through
both
their
skin
and
lungs
and
how
easily
polluted
their
small
squishy
bodies
are
When
the
smoke
rolls
into
their
cramped
burrows
what
will
this
rancid
air
do
to
them
Will
any
tiger
salamanders
crawl
out
this
winter
when
the
rains
finally
come
If
they
come
Or
will
they
all
die
in
there
Smoked
Jerkied
Little
golden-flecked
mummies
hard
as
old
bubblegum
Will
anyone
notice
Will
tiger
salamanders
make
the
news
if
we
kill
off
the
last
one
Will
people
finally
realize
how
cute
they
were
and
wonder
why
no
one
had
told
them
earlier
before
it
was
too
late
According
to
ancient
belief
salamanders
have
nothing
to
fear
from
fire
The
Talmud
describes
salamanders
as
being
born
of
fire
and
that
anyone
who
covered
themselves
in
the
blood
of
salamanders
would
be
immune
to
burning
In
Greek
the
name
salamander
means
fire
lizard
Both
Pliny
the
Elder
and
Aristotle
claimed
that
salamanders
could
extinguish
fires
with
their
wet
icy
skin
Leonardo
da
Vinci
said
that
salamanders
have
no
digestive
organs
and
get
no
food
but
from
the
fire
in
which
it
constantly
renews
its
scaly
skin
People
also
long
believed
that
the
fire-proof
substance
asbestos
was
made
from
the
fur
of
salamanders
It
s
thought
that
these
archaic
misconceptions
arose
from
the
fact
that
salamanders
often
burrow
beneath
and
sometimes
inside
of
rotting
wood
and
throughout
history
as
people
placed
these
logs
into
their
fires
salamanders
would
crawl
out
of
the
flames
I
found
myself
wishing
the
mythology
of
the
fire
lizards
was
true
As
the
August
Complex
Fire
California
s
first-ever
gigafire
one
that
is
larger
than
a
million
acres
burned
to
the
north
of
me
and
the
nearby
hillsides
around
Santa
Rosa
were
an
inferno
to
the
east
and
the
Santa
Cruz
Mountains
to
my
south
were
engulfed
in
flames
until
they
ran
straight
into
the
sea
I
wished
that
somehow
in
the
charred
wake
of
all
this
destruction
millions
of
salamanders
would
materialize
Slow-motion
phoenixes
rising
from
the
ashes
with
their
long
tails
fat
legs
yellow
spots
and
a
knowing
look
in
their
wet
protruding
eyes
that
says
We
come
from
where
you
re
headed
and
you
re
not
going
to
like
it
there
But
of
course
tiger
salamanders
like
most
other
lifeforms
will
not
emerge
from
these
fires
but
will
instead
be
destroyed
by
them
And
it
isn
t
just
Northern
California
that
s
changed
the
entire
planet
has
All
the
way
down
to
the
fish
in
the
sea
Why
should
I
care
about
some
salamander
anyway
It
s
a
question
I
get
from
the
construction
crew
on
nearly
every
job
site
and
you
can
replace
salamander
with
whatever
species
I
might
be
there
to
protect
dusky-footed
woodrats
Alameda
whipsnakes
red-legged
frogs
desert
tortoise
We
have
houses
to
build
for
actual
human
beings
isn
t
that
more
important
Well
yes
sure
But
also
no
We
need
tiger
salamanders
and
all
other
plants
and
animals
because
what
s
killing
them
is
also
killing
us
A
California
with
a
healthy
tiger
salamander
population
is
a
place
where
we
re
all
healthier
Tiger
salamanders
need
both
undisturbed
habitat
and
enough
clean
unpolluted
water
to
fill
their
breeding
pools
every
year
They
don
t
have
it
It
s
the
same
reason
you
might
not
have
enough
water
in
your
well
It
s
the
same
reason
farmers
can
t
keep
their
crops
from
drying
out
It
s
the
same
reason
cities
are
fighting
over
and
diverting
distant
streams
to
keep
the
taps
flowing
And
it
s
the
reason
why
California
had
its
first
gigafire
last
year
which
will
surely
not
be
the
last
just
as
the
SARS-CoV-2
pandemic
will
not
be
the
last
virus
to
spill
from
the
bloodstreams
of
animals
into
our
own
with
our
endless
violent
encroachment
into
wildlands
My
job
is
to
protect
the
disappearing
animal
species
of
California
I
think
of
these
animals
as
ambassadors
to
the
apocalypse
Tiger
salamanders
are
trying
to
tell
us
something
by
their
very
disappearance
if
the
world
isn
t
healthy
enough
for
us
it
isn
t
healthy
enough
for
you
either
We
would
be
wise
to
heed
the
warnings
of
those
species
who
are
showing
us
where
we
re
all
headed
because
there
is
no
more
urgent
form
of
communication
than
going
extinct
I
dream
of
water
Every
day
as
I
wake
to
more
smoke
more
news
of
another
fire
ripping
through
nearby
hills
I
dream
of
heavy
clouds
galloping
gathering
rolling
in
from
the
sea
white-gray
baskets
sloshing
with
clean
rainwater
that
burst
open
as
they
sweep
across
the
West
drenching
us
rinsing
us
reminding
us
of
what
this
world
could
and
should
be
So
much
water
that
each
dimple
in
the
landscape
fills
up
turns
green
and
writhes
with
life
again
I
dream
of
a
world
where
people
don
t
simply
care
about
the
many
creatures
we
share
this
planet
with
but
celebrate
them
A
world
where
tiger
salamanders
migrate
by
the
thousands
on
the
first
good
rain
of
the
year
again
so
many
they
walk
over
each
other
s
backs
all
of
them
wet
and
vigorous
breathing
pure
air
through
yellow-speckled
skin
while
the
people
come
outside
to
line
up
and
watch

Every
year
on
St
Patrick
s
Day
I
brace
myself
for
a
flood
of
articles
about
Ireland
Almost
always
these
stories
rely
on
a
series
of
well-worn
tropes
that
caricature
the
place
I
call
home
No
doubt
you
ve
read
stories
which
reference
Irish
people
s
love
of
alcohol
and
seen
images
of
random
things
dyed
green
While
living
in
the
U.
S.
I
became
accustomed
to
talking
to
strangers
about
Ireland
I
have
curly
red
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
freckled
complexion
My
Irish
accent
is
inescapable
When
you
look
as
Irish
as
I
do
strangers
want
to
talk
to
you
about
it
I
didn
t
mind
but
the
stereotypes
did
grow
tiresome
For
a
while
I
worked
with
a
nonprofit
focused
on
developing
leadership
skills
among
college
students
from
Ireland
and
Northern
Ireland
The
program
was
established
in
the
90s
in
response
to
the
sectarian
violence
euphemistically
known
as
The
Troubles
Though
the
island
has
been
relatively
peaceful
since
the
late
90s
I
would
occasionally
meet
Americans
who
still
imagined
my
homeland
to
be
a
dangerous
frightening
place
St
Patrick
s
Day
is
in
essence
a
great
story
According
to
the
legend
Patrick
was
a
sinner
a
most
simple
countryman
At
16
he
was
kidnapped
and
brought
to
pagan
Ireland
He
spent
six
years
working
as
a
shepherd
and
during
this
time
found
God
He
later
converted
Ireland
to
Christianity
This
simple
fifth-century
story
was
the
foundation
for
Ireland
s
identity
In
recent
decades
Ireland
has
changed
fundamentally
It
is
no
longer
the
twee
caricature
that
exists
in
our
collective
imagination
When
I
was
born
in
the
late
80s
Ireland
was
powerfully
discriminatory
toward
anyone
who
veered
outside
its
so-called
Christian
values
Once
married
women
who
worked
in
the
public
service
were
fired
Divorce
was
illegal
Rape
within
marriage
was
legal
Abortion
was
illegal
in
almost
all
circumstances
Homosexuality
was
a
criminal
offense
In
1982
an
Irish
gay
man
named
Declan
Flynn
was
murdered
in
Fairview
Park
in
Dublin
Despite
two
of
his
attackers
admitting
their
role
in
his
death
they
served
no
jail
time
All
of
you
come
from
good
homes
the
judge
said
In
Northern
Ireland
The
Troubles
seemed
destined
to
continue
indefinitely
Since
then
Ireland
has
modernized
I
was
8
when
in
1995
divorce
was
finally
made
legal
after
a
bitter
referendum
It
passed
by
the
narrowest
of
margins
50
28
%
in
favor
and
49
79
%
against
In
1998
the
Good
Friday
Agreement
ended
most
of
the
violence
in
Northern
Ireland
though
peace
remains
fragile
Declan
Flynn
s
murder
sparked
a
queer
movement
and
in
2015
62
%
of
people
voted
to
allow
same-sex
marriage
Ireland
was
the
first
country
in
the
world
to
legalize
gay
marriage
by
popular
vote
In
2018
66
%
of
people
voted
to
allow
access
to
abortion
The
Ireland
of
my
youth
was
almost
uniformly
white
When
I
left
secondary
school
there
was
one
black
student
in
a
school
of
more
than
700
pupils
These
days
Irish
towns
and
villages
are
home
to
vibrant
diverse
communities
Equally
as
a
child
I
had
almost
no
interaction
with
the
Traveller
community
which
was
formally
recognized
as
an
ethnic
minority
in
2017
Irish
Travellers
have
a
rich
cultural
history
which
merits
a
list
of
its
own
For
those
interested
in
knowing
more
I
d
really
recommend
Rosaleen
McDonagh
s
latest
book
Unsettled
Ireland
has
changed
and
yet
I
m
not
sure
that
international
audiences
have
updated
their
mental
image
To
be
fair
our
tourism
industry
has
long
understood
that
there
s
money
to
be
made
selling
Ireland
as
the
land
of
saints
and
scholars
That
is
part
of
Ireland
but
it
s
not
the
complete
picture
This
reading
list
offers
a
more
complicated
portrait
of
Ireland
It
is
necessarily
shaped
by
my
sensibilities
as
a
queer
feminist
I
m
white
middle
class
and
able-bodied
a
set
of
experiences
that
have
undoubtedly
informed
my
worldview
Other
Irish
writers
would
compile
a
very
different
list
and
I
hope
they
do
But
this
is
my
take
For
a
tiny
island
on
the
edge
of
Europe
we
get
outsized
attention
today
I
hope
that
this
collection
of
longreads
pushes
people
to
examine
their
simplified
notions
of
this
country

Acclaimed
Irish
folk
singer
Christy
Moore
wrote
a
haunting
song
about
Ann
s
death
In
1984
15-year-old
schoolgirl
Ann
Lovett
died
after
giving
birth
to
a
baby
boy
in
a
grotto
in
Granard
County
Longford
The
story
shocked
the
nation
and
the
world
Overnight
the
small
village
of
Granard
was
swamped
with
national
and
international
media
The
community
banded
together
refusing
to
speak
to
the
media
Her
death
sparked
a
seminal
national
debate
on
women
giving
birth
outside
marriage
Just
four
months
before
she
died
two-thirds
of
the
Irish
people
voted
to
enshrine
the
right
to
life
of
the
unborn
in
the
Irish
Constitution
This
controversial
Eighth
Amendment
to
the
constitution
wasn
t
overturned
until
2018
Vicky
Langan
the
daughter
of
Ann
s
boyfriend
wrote
about
the
impact
of
Ann
s
death
on
her
family
through
the
generations
To
mark
what
would
have
been
Ann
s
50th
birthday
award-winning
journalist
Rosita
Boland
spoke
with
her
friends
and
eventually
her
boyfriend
to
remember
her
life
and
the
impact
her
shocking
death
had
on
Irish
society
This
piece
goes
some
way
toward
restoring
Ann
s
dignity
as
a
complicated
rounded
person
in
her
own
right
Ann
Lovett
s
name
has
been
synonymous
with
Ireland
s
horrific
treatment
of
women
but
as
this
piece
shows
she
was
so
much
more
than
that
Ann
took
the
scissors
out
of
her
schoolbag
leaving
the
bag
near
the
entrance
Sometime
between
12
45pm
and
4pm
she
lay
down
beside
the
workhouse
chapel
railings
removed
her
underwear
and
gave
birth
in
the
rain
She
cut
the
umbilical
cord
with
the
scissors
she
had
brought
from
home
and
wrapped
her
dead
baby
in
her
coat
He
was
full
term
and
weighed
6½
pounds
Then
she
lay
down
again
on
the
wet
mossy
gravel
in
her
school
uniform
in
the
persistent
rain
without
her
coat
her
body
beginning
to
go
into
irreversible
shock
Looking
at
the
grim
statistics
in
Ireland
the
most
dangerous
place
for
a
woman
is
her
home
Since
1996
244
women
have
died
violently
Of
these
deaths
62
%
happened
in
their
homes
and
87
%
were
killed
by
a
man
known
to
them
Eighteen
children
have
died
alongside
their
mothers
and
in
all
but
one
murder-suicide
case
the
killer
was
the
woman
s
partner
Despite
this
epidemic
of
violence
against
women
many
Irish
media
outlets
fail
to
understand
the
true
scale
of
the
crisis
Colin
Barrett
examines
the
August
2016
murder
of
Clodagh
Hawe
and
her
three
young
sons
Liam
Niall
and
Ryan
The
killer
Alan
Hawe
Clodagh
s
husband
and
the
boys
father
died
by
suicide
Often
in
Ireland
cases
like
these
are
framed
as
family
tragedies
In
this
case
media
coverage
emphasized
how
well-respected
the
killer
was
in
the
local
community
and
speculated
as
to
some
unknown
mental
distress
he
must
have
been
experiencing
This
piece
rightly
focuses
its
attention
on
the
invisible
tyranny
of
domestic
abuse
situating
these
murders
as
the
terminal
act
in
an
escalating
pattern
of
violence
and
fear
Language
in
its
quest
to
be
accurate
and
as
concise
as
possible
can
be
callous
and
the
hyphen
in
the
term
‘
murder-suicide
is
a
violent
coupling
a
forcing
together
into
a
state
of
symbiotic
equivalence
two
things
that
are
not
of
course
symbiotic
or
equivalent
at
all
The
hyphen
welding
‘
murder
to
‘
suicide
implies
that
each
state
is
as
bad
or
as
tragic
as
the
other
That
the
murderer
who
then
commits
suicide
is
on
some
level
as
much
a
victim
as
those
he
murdered
is
paying
a
commensurate
price
within
a
larger
indivisible
spectrum
of
suffering
signified
by
that
conjoining
hyphen
But
what
happened
to
the
Hawe
family
was
not
only
a
‘
murder-suicide
It
was
first
and
foremost
a
multiple
murder
committed
by
a
man
who
then
committed
suicide
Nuala
O
Faolain
died
of
cancer
in
2008
Before
she
died
she
appeared
on
The
Marian
Finucane
Show
to
talk
about
her
terminal
diagnosis
A
documentary
was
later
made
about
her
life
Perhaps
the
best
way
to
introduce
Nuala
O
Faolain
is
to
recount
the
time
she
went
on
The
Late
Late
Show
and
told
the
bemused
host
that
she
d
had
lots
of
sex
often
just
for
the
exercise
It
was
1996
and
women
s
sexuality
was
simply
never
discussed
Her
candor
was
part
of
what
made
her
memoir
a
bestseller
She
describes
the
Ireland
of
her
youth
as
a
living
tomb
for
women
and
recounts
her
experiences
with
men
alcohol
and
the
Catholic
Church
Many
American
readers
with
an
interest
in
Irish
literature
have
read
male
authors
like
Colm
Tóibín
and
Frank
McCourt
Books
by
both
of
these
men
have
subsequently
been
made
into
Hollywood
movies
reaching
even
larger
audiences
Irish
women
almost
never
get
that
opportunity
O
Faolain
s
book
gives
an
important
snapshot
into
the
life
of
Irish
women
who
in
many
cases
suffered
while
the
men
in
their
lives
flourished
If
she
were
alive
today
she
d
be
celebrated
as
a
virtuoso
of
the
personal
essay
and
an
authority
on
living
your
life
on
your
own
terms
They
were
Mother
and
Father
and
does
a
child
know
any
different
Sure
it
made
me
bedwet
when
he
came
home
pissed
and
pummelled
my
mother
Her
cries
for
help
were
heartrending
and
made
me
try
to
sleep
in
a
chest
of
drawers
Throughout
the
Troubles
the
Irish
Republican
Army
IRA
had
a
policy
of
killing
suspected
informants
The
case
of
Jean
McConville
a
widowed
mother
of
10
was
especially
heinous
She
was
taken
from
her
home
in
1972
Her
remains
were
eventually
discovered
31
years
later
A
police
investigation
found
no
evidence
that
McConville
was
an
informant
Many
thousands
of
articles
have
been
written
about
The
Troubles
I
ve
selected
this
piece
as
a
useful
introduction
for
readers
interested
in
learning
more
about
this
long
and
brutal
conflict
It
evokes
the
particular
cruelty
of
disappearing
a
young
mother
leaving
her
children
in
a
purgatory
of
uncertainty
Patrick
Radden
Keefe
s
article
was
later
expanded
into
a
book

Nothing

True
Story
of
Murder
and
Memory
in
Northern
Ireland
Jean
McConville
had
just
taken
a
bath
when
the
intruders
knocked
on
the
door
A
small
woman
with
a
guarded
smile
she
was
at
thirty-seven
a
mother
of
ten
She
was
also
a
widow
her
husband
Arthur
had
died
eleven
months
earlier
of
cancer
The
family
continued
to
live
in
Divis
Flats—a
housing
complex
just
off
the
Falls
Road
in
the
heart
of
Catholic
West
Belfast—but
had
recently
moved
to
a
slightly
larger
apartment
The
stove
was
not
connected
yet
so
Jean
s
daughter
Helen
who
was
fifteen
had
gone
to
a
nearby
chip
shop
to
bring
back
dinner
Don
t
be
stopping
for
a
sneaky
smoke
Jean
told
her
It
was
December
1972
and
already
dark
at
6:30
P.
M
When
the
children
heard
the
knock
they
assumed
that
it
was

On
June

1994
in
the
small
village
of
Loughinisland
County
Down
a
pub
was
crowded
with

watching
the
Republic
of
Ireland
play
in

Ulster

into
the

and

Six

were

and

Documentarian
Alex
Gibney
set
out
to
make
a
documentary
about
the
events
of
that
night
interviewing
victims
families
former
terrorists
officers
from
Northern
Ireland
s
police
force
then
the
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
and
other
government
officials
Despite
an
extraordinary
amount
of
physical
evidence
and
damning
testimony
no
one
was
ever
charged
with
the
crime
While
making
the
documentary
filmmakers
uncovered
evidence
of
collusion
between
police
and
paramilitary
forces
Rather
than
investigating
these
allegations
the
police
arrested
two
of
the
film
s
producers
Trevor
Birney
and
Barry
McCaffrey
The
case
attracted
worldwide
attention
and
sparked
a
campaign
on
the
importance
of
press
freedom
This
article
asks
whether
secrecy
should
be
the
price
for
peace
and
how
the
families
impacted
by
The
Troubles
can
move
forward
without
achieving
justice
for
their
loved
ones
From
the
perspective
of
the
government
keeping
secrets
is
the
price
of
law
and
order
But
from
the
perspective
of
victims
and
survivors
a
secret
that
hides
the
truth
is
not
any
kind
of
justice
it
means
getting
away
with
murder
The
Ireland
of
my
childhood
was
almost
entirely
white
Living
in
a
rural
area
I
rarely
encountered
anyone
who
didn
t
look
like
me
Growing
up
in
Dublin
Emma
Dabiri
was
having
a
very
different
experience
Through
the
lens
of
black
hair
she
writes
movingly
about
how
being
different
meant
living
under
constant
surveillance
Ireland
s
identity
as
the
land
of
saints
and
scholars
dates
back
more
than
600
years
In
that
time
it
has
almost
always
been
associated
with
Christianity
and
classical
learning
Dabiri
s
work
as
an
academic
broadcaster
and
author
expands
this
narrow
interpretation
This
piece
is
an
extract
from
her
book
Twisted
The
Tangled
History
of
Black
Hair
Culture
which
explores
how
black
hair
has
been
appropriated
and
stigmatized
throughout
history
As
a
black
child
with
tightly
coiled
hair
growing
up
in
an
incredibly
white
homogeneous
socially
conservative
Ireland
I
certainly
wasn
t
considered
pretty
but
that
started
to
change
in
my
midteens
I
remember
being
told
that
I
was
lucky
I
was
pretty
which
meant
I
could
almost
get
away
with
being
black
In
recent
decades
Ireland
has
become
home
to
an
increasing
number
of
asylum
seekers
Migrants
seeking
asylum
in
Ireland
are
forcibly
housed
in
a
series
of
Direct
Provision
centers
which
are
often
located
in
dilapidated
buildings
in
isolated
parts
of
Ireland
Asylum
seekers
receive
a
meager
daily
allowance
and
many
live
in
shared
rooms
without
access
to
a
kitchen
Caelainn
Hogan
speaks
to
several
people
caught
up
in
Ireland
s
inhumane
asylum
system
which
sees
a
small
number
of
companies
profit
from
human
misery
Her
reporting
on
individual
stories
illuminates
the
details
of
how
the
lives
of
asylum
seekers
are
warped
by
a
merciless
bureaucratic
system
and
shows
just
how
difficult
it
is
for
them
to
establish
safe
and
independent
lives
in
Ireland
The
first
reception
centre
Joy
was
sent
to
was
Balseskin
the
entry
point
for
most
asylum-seekers
to
the
direct-provision
system
It
is
known
by
many
as
the
‘
camp
a
maze
of
Portacabins
hidden
off
a
narrow
road
near
to
a
sparse
expanse
of
industrial
estates
in
Finglas
close
to
IKEA
and

airport
Most
people
would
only
pass
near
to
it

Sean
Quinn
s
name
is
ubiquitous
in
Ireland
In
2008
he
was
the
richest
man
in
the
country
with
business
interests
across
health
insurance
construction
and
hospitality
His
status
in
the
local
community
was
almost
messianic
But
by
2011
following
a
series
of
risky
investments
he
had
filed
for
bankruptcy
What
followed
was
a
campaign
of
torture
terror
and
revenge
that
rarely
made
the
national
news
As
The
Irish
Times
noted
if
the
same
thing
happened
in
Dublin
it
would
have
been
treated
as

emergency
This
deeply
reported
story
deftly
reveals
the
complicated
dynamics
of
rural

particularly
in
regions
suffering
from

under-investment
There
has
been

Chammah
s
work
at
The
Marshall
Project
a
nonprofit
outlet
publishing
journalism
and
news
about
the
U.
S
criminal
justice
system
I
ve
been
in
a
lot
of
conversations
lately
in
which
a
two-word
phrase
is
spoken
true
crime
and
then
during
the
ensuing
beat
of
silence
everyone
reads
the
room
and
modulates
their
reactions
based
on
the
expressions
of
everyone
else
Or
maybe
it
s
just
me
For
some
the
phrase
simply
sparks
exclamations
and
recommendations
stories
of
late
nights
spent
binging
The

or
I

Be

Dark
But
others
wince
because
no
matter
how
sophisticated
the
storytelling
or
agreeable
the
politics
an
icky
aftertaste
remains
Since
2014
when
the
podcast
Serial
inaugurated
the
new
true-crime
boom
cultural
critics
have
tried
to
puzzle
out
whether
these
factually
accurate
but
necessarily
sculpted
stories
of
murder
rape
and
grift
are
culturally
valuable
corrosive
or
both
Among
the
critiques
We
re
skewing
our
view
of
who
is
the
most
vulnerable
in
America
through
a
myopic
focus
on
white
women
victims
We
ve
rotted
women
s
brains
with
paranoia
and
[
entrenched
]
the
flaws
of
America
s
criminal
justice
system
On
the
other
hand
as
lawyer
and
podcast
host
Rabia
Chaudry
recently
pointed
out
to
the
New
York
Times
the
genre
can
also
invite
more
scrutiny
of
the
justice
system
Over
the
last
five
years
while
writing
a
book
about
the
death
penalty
and
a
narrative
story
about
a
controversial
murder
investigation
I
ve
noticed
that
our
debates
sometimes
fail
to
articulate
that
when
we
say
true
crime
we
re
really
talking
about
a
huge
variety
of
story
types
one
of
which
is
especially
good
at
taking
readers
right
to
the
heart
of
important
policy
questions
I
ll
call
it
the
Wrongful
Conviction
Story
a
subgenre
of
true
crime
that
examines
the
failures
of
police
courts
and
other
government
actors
and
questions
whether
they
ve
caught
and
punished
the
correct
person
I
m
not
calling
it
the
Innocence
Story
because
wrongful
is
a
subjective
adjective
implying
an
argument
is
being
made
while
innocence
implies
the
writer
can
fully
prove
the
objective
truth
which
usually
they
can
t
These
stories
aren
t
necessarily
out
to
answer
whether
someone
is
guilty
or
innocent
They
re
about
the
failures
of
a
system
that
ensnares
millions
of
Americans
each
year
innocent
and
guilty
A
few
years
ago
I
heard
another
writer
say
that
magazine
editors
didn
t
want
these
stories
anymore
because
they
were
no
longer
surprising
to
readers
That
may
be
overstated
but
it
is
true
that
journalists
need
to
keep
innovating
in
terms
of
how
we
build
narratives
if
we
re
going
to
get
readers
to
follow
us
into
a
system
full
of
misery
pain
and
jargon
like
voir
dire
and
Brady
violation
showing
them
the
real
thing
rather
than
the
tidy
heroes-and-villains
worlds
of
Law
&
Order
and
NCIS
I
ve
collected
a
handful
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
Wrongful
Conviction
Story
Each
represents
a
further
slice
of
the
subgenre
along
with
other
stories
I
think
are
worth
your
attention
if
you
want
to
go
deeper
whether
because
you
re
a
fellow
journalist
a
lawyer
very
much
a
profession
in
which
one
tells
stories
or
just
a
curious
reader
Pamela
Colloff
didn
t
invent
the
wrongful
conviction
magazine
story
but
she
did
perfect
it
While
working
for
Texas
Monthly
ProPublica
and
The
New
York
Times
Magazine
she
s
figured
out
how
to
foreground
action
and
build
characters
efficiently
so
that
you
can
slip
into
the
pool
with
her
protagonists
and
feel
their
panic
as
they
start
to
drown
One
of
her
lesser-known
tales
concerns
Julie
Rea
a
single
mother
convicted
of
killing
her
10-year-old
son
Joel
based
on
faulty
analysis
of
blood
at
the
crime
scene
We
learn
about
blood
spatter
but
spend
most
of
our
time
on
Rea
s
four
traumas
losing
her
son
being
falsely
convicted
going
to
prison
and
trying
to
make
her
way
again
in
the
free
world
In
the
wake
of
the
murder
she
could
not
bear
to
be
alone
Terrified
of
the
dark
she
rarely
slept
She
stayed
in
an
apartment
an
hour-and-a-half
s
drive
away
in
Bloomington
Indiana
where
she
had
been
commuting
to
Indiana
University
s
Ph
D
program
There
a
rotation
of
friends
stayed
with
her
around
the
clock
To
fall
asleep
I
had
to
have
someone
on
either
side
of
me
and
the
lights
on

More
from
Pamela
Colloff
s
oeuvre
It
s
pretty
bold
to
make
the
second
word
of
your
article
your
own
name
but
anyone
who
has
listened
to
Serial
understands
that
it
can
be
valuable
for
the
journalist
to
present
him
or
herself
as
a
first-person
narrator
I
d
been
struggling
with
whether
this
was
worth
doing
in
my
own
writing
and
I
was
impressed
with
how
Maya
Dukmasova
utilized
her
own
ambivalence
and
the
more
freewheeling
prose
style
typical
of
alt-weeklies
like
the
Chicago
Reader
to
propel
the
reader
into
her
tale
of
a
potentially
innocent
Illinois
prisoner
She
also
goes
meta
discussing
Janet
Malcolm
s
seminal
book
The
Journalist
and
the
Murderer
and
the
sticky
ethics
of
reporting
on
someone
who
tells
you
they
re
innocent
You
say
you
believe
them
but
both
of
you
may
be
lying
Publishing
a
story
someone
doesn
t
want
out
there
is
an
act
of
betrayal
even
if
you
have
no
relationship
to
them
As
a
journalist
especially
a
white
one
the
way
you
justify
it
to
yourself
is
by
saying
that
the
story
is
bigger
than
its
central
character
that
his
life
experiences
aren
t
really
just
his
to
publicize
or
keep
private
that
they
belong
to
everyone
This
line
of
thinking
is
particularly
potent
when
you
ve
already
invested
significant
time
and
energy
into
a
story—as
though
with
that
expenditure
you
ve
purchased
a
person
s
right
to
refuse
or
consent
to
be
written
about
I
d
done
a
lot
of
digging
by
then
I
decided
to
keep
going
partially
because
it
felt
too
late
to
turn
back
and
also
because
I
believed
what
happened
to
Allen
was
wrong
even
if
I
didn
t
fully
believe
him
More
stories
from
alt-weeklies
Stories
about
the
court
system
s
failures
are
generally
best
when
they
focus
on
people
but
this
story
artfully
foregrounds
a
canine
character
exploring
the
dubious
science
of
cadaver
dogs
as
the
latest
of
the
forensic
disciplines
that
judges
lawyers
and
researchers
are
finding
lack
any
real
scientific
backing
Many
such
stories
look
at
trials
from
the
distant
past
but
Peter
Andrey
Smith
manages
to
capture
multiple
timelines
while
also
centering
a
tragic
Colorado
case
that
is
very
much
happening
now
and
features
a
duel
between
a
star
expert
witness
and
the
Innocence
Project
lawyers
questioning
her
claims
Behind
a
dog
s
leathery
wet
nose
lies
a
cavernous
labyrinth
of
scroll-shaped
chambers
called
ethmoturbinates
lined
with
some
200
million
olfactory
receptors
encoded
by
an
estimated
2
5
times
as
many
genes
as
in
humans
In
recent
years
researchers
studying
canine
cognition
have
shown
pet
dogs
can
sniff
out
minute
quantities
of
odorants
such
as
the
odor
of
their
owner
s
T-shirt
after
it
has
been
worn
More
forensic
science
stories
On
the
other
hand
If
a
writer
is
too
focused
on
the
people
or
the
dogs
they
may
miss
the
big
picture
dynamics
When
an
innocent
person
goes
to
prison
it
s
a
failure
of
multiple
people
and
institutions
I
love
how
Neena
Satija
uses
a
single

charge
a
more
common
crime
than
murder
the
typical
focus
of
wrongful
conviction
stories
to
help
us
understand
the
problems
of
money

and
red
tape
that
surround
how
people
who
can
t
afford
to
pay
for
lawyers
get
represented
or
not

Wilford
did
not
know
this
What
he
did
know
was
that
…
Espersen
didn
t
seem
to
be
listening
The
visitation
room
was
tiny
and
the
two
sat
practically
knee

knee
but
he
was
looking
at
the
floor
scratching

at

Wilford
recalled
More
stories
that
capture
a
big
system
Did
you
hear
the
one
about
the
golf
magazine
that
helped
free
a
man
from
prison
While
serving
a
long
sentence
for
murder
Valentino
Dixon
grew
obsessed
with
drawing
golf
courses
which
caught
the
attention
of
Golf
Digest
But
the
editors
there
also
found
his
conviction
suspicious
and
they
dug
in
Dixon
is
now
free
and
the
original
article
about
his
case
involves
a
fascinating
juxtaposition
of
hard-nosed
criminal
justice
reporting
and
Dixon
s
honest
intimate
account
of
finding
mental
solace
through
his
ordeal
by
drawing
greens
holes
and
trees
I
ve
never
hit
a
golf
ball
I
ve
never
set
foot
on
a
golf
course
Everything
I
draw
is
from
inside
a
6-by-10
prison
cell
The
first
course
I
ever
drew
was
for
warden
James
Conway
He
would
often
stop
by
my
cell
to
ask
how
my
appeal
was
going
and
to
see
my
drawings
Before
he
retired
the
warden
brought
me
a
photograph
of
the
12th
hole
at
Augusta
National
and
asked
if
I
could
draw
it
for
him
…
The
look
of
a
golf
hole
spoke
to
me
It
seemed
peaceful
I
imagine
playing
it
would
be
a
lot
like
fishing
More
first-person
writing
from
the
proven-innocent
It
s
sad
to
say
but
many
readers
now
shrug
when
they
see
a
headline
like
Innocent
Person
Freed
because
the
phenomenon
feels
so
common
The
stories
told
about
these
cases
can
fall
into
patterns
and
cliches
that
lose
readers
One
solution
is
to
focus
not
on
the
story
of
the
wrongfully
accused
but
on
someone
else
involved
in
the
case
Reporter
Debbie
Nathan
was
even
more
creative
ceding
the
voice
of
her
story
almost
entirely
over
to
Kyle
Zirpolo
a
young
man
who
as
a
child
had
accused
adults
of
sexual
crimes
but
later
realized
he
d
been
pressured
by
the
authorities
to
invent
the
stories
Nathan
follows
up
his
account
with
the
backstory
of
why
he
came
forward
Anytime
I
would
give
them
an
answer
that
they
didn
t
like
they
would
ask
again
and
encourage
me
to
give
them
the
answer
they
were
looking
for
It
was
really
obvious
what
they
wanted
I
know
the
types
of
language
they
used
on
me
things
like
I
was
smart
or
I
could

the

who
were

More
stories
about
the
effects
of
wrongful
convictions
on
people
outside
prison
I
remember
vividly
sitting
in
a
coffee
shop
in
Austin
as
the
sun
set
squinting
and
ignoring
my
stomach
growls
while
I
inhaled
each
twist
in
Mike
Hall
s
story
about
a
murder
mystery
and
the
many
lives
consumed
in
its
wake
There
are
questions
around
forensic
science
and
the
behavior
of
prosecutors
but
Hall
keeps
casting
his
camera
in
new
directions
novelistically
accreting
details
and
tapping
true-crime
conventions
to
lead
us
towards
ineffable
questions
of
time
tragedy
and
justice

Spence
insisted
he
couldn
t
remember
murdering
anyone
but
he
began
to
wonder
if
it
was
possible
that
he
had
really
done
it
Did
I
kill

I

the
deputy
Why

I

More
kaleidoscopic
character-driven
tales
Let
s
end
this
on
a
note
of
caution
For
every
somber
reporting
project
there
s
some
juicy
content
that
uses
the
tools
and
stylistic
modes
of
journalism
but
lets
either
entertainment
or
advocacy
take
precedence
I
ve
returned
maybe
a
dozen
times
to
Kathryn
Schulz
s
essay
on
Making
a
Murderer
which
explores
why
journalists
filmmakers
and
others
have
grown
comfortable
questioning
the
verdicts
of
the
courts
and
what
the
costs
of
this
can
be
especially
for
the
grieving
families
at
the
center
of
these
cases
Yet
the
most
obvious
thing
to
say
about
true-crime
documentaries
is
something
that
surprisingly
often
goes
unsaid
They
turn
people
s
private
tragedies
into
public
entertainment
If
you
have
lost
someone
to
violent
crime
you
know
that
other
than
the
loss
itself
few
things
are
as
painful
and
galling
as
the
daily
media
coverage
and
the
license
it
gives
to
strangers
to
weigh
in
on
what
happened
That
experience
is
difficult
enough
when
the
coverage
is
local
and
unimaginable
when
a
major
media
production
turns
your
story
into
a
national
pastime

We
re
on
the
Appalachian
Trail
2,190
infamous
miles
stretching
like
history
itself
from
Georgia
to
Maine
across
14
states
and
up
roughly
16
Mount
Everests
of
elevation

My
parents
have
been
hiking
for
much
of
that
history
backpacking
across
the
high
peak
wilderness
of
Sequoia
National
Park
trekking
through
the
Tetons
for
their
cross-country
honeymoon
cross-country
skiing
along
Rocky
Mountain
glaciers

through

American
River
Canyon
in

own
Sierra

foothills
But
they
re
approaching
the
AT
for
the
first
time
It
s
early
September
and
fall
dapples
above
and
below
us
in
the
translucent
beech
canopy
coloring
the
sun
lichen-green
and
in
the
carpet
of
clay-red
sugar
maple
leaves
My
parents
take
their
inaugural
steps
Welcome
to
the
AT
I
say
pushing
through
my
fatigue
to
evoke
the
energy
of
a
highly
anticipated
debut
Thanks
my
mom
says
with
a
smile
summoning
enthusiasm
from
a
stream
that
has
run
dry
Even
the
AT
doesn
t
seem
to
be

Back
in
the
car
we
had
listened
to
The
Appalachian
Trail
A
Biography
The
route
is
known
as
the
green
tunnel
Philip
D
Anieri
writes
because
of
its
infinite
canopy
coverage
Unlike
many
Western
trails
the
AT
wasn
t
designed
for
horses
who
can
usually
only
manage
up
to
20
%
grades
so
the
path
is
usually
straight
up
and
down
without
any
switchbacks
And
there
are
hardly
any
people
of
color
with
roughly
95
%
of
AT
thru-hikers
identifying
as
white
And
yet
only
minutes
into
our
debut
we
re
switchbacking
up
the
bare
face
of
Bear
Mountain
the
unfiltered
sun
weighing
against
our
backs
and
two
Latina
women
are
walking
quietly
behind
us
as
if
the
AT
refuses
to
squeeze
into
the
definitions
others
have
given
it
Mom
is
still
unimpressed
She
falls
behind
by
the
second
switchback
Dad
waits
for
her
as
I
climb
on
feeling
a
restlessness
that
I
tell
myself
all
hikers
feel
at
some
point
And
yet
it
s
deeper
than
that
heavier
more
complicated
and
I
can
t
make
sense
of
it
Why
with
the
one
person
who
has
been
waiting
for
me
in
some
way
or
another
almost
my
entire

so
impatient
What
type
of
son

I
become
By
the
last
set
of
switchbacks
my
dad
has
decided
to
go
ahead
without
her
Is
everything
okay
I
ask
when
we
both
reach
the
summit
looking
out
at
the
miles
of
trail
that
still
lie
ahead
Yeah
I
think
her
hip
is
hurting
His
voice
trails
off
as
if
there
s
more
that
he
s
not

But
he
doesn

The
pieces
have
been
silently
falling
out
since
the
beginning
of
their
New
York
trip
and
I
m
finally
starting
to
put
the
picture
together
On
our
fifth
day
the
day
God
made
creatures
in
the
sea
and
birds
in
the
sky
we
migrate
upstate
to
the
High
Peaks
located
within
the
six-million-acre
forever
wild
forest
preserve
that
is
Adirondack
Park

largest

spent
the
first
four
days

with

and

film
premieres
and

and

was

time
to
breathe
let
alone
to
breach
the
questions

ve
been
waiting
to
ask
Questions
about
race
ancestors
belonging

Questions
we
ve
avoided
all
of
my
life
But

seem
willing

spend
our
first
upstate
morning
lounging
in
Adirondack
chairs
around
our
cottage

outdoor
fire
pit
Dad
laughs
through
his
nose
at
Barack

s
biography
Then
he
dozes
off
Mom
taps
her
foot
as
she
stares
into
a
novel
I
make
my
way
through
Maya
Angelou
s
collection
of
poetry
a
book
I
ve
been
wanting
to
read
ever
since
my
visit
to
Eudora
Arkansas
The
southeastern-most
corner
of
the
state
about
three
miles
west
of
Mississippi
and
seven
miles
north
of
Louisiana
along
the
great
Mississippi
River
Delta
Basin
My
dad
s
parents
grew
up
there
spending
their
mornings
picking
cotton
as
sharecroppers
and
their
afternoons
studying
at
Eudora
Colored
High
Eventually
they
became
valedictorian
and
salutatorian
Then
they
left
and
never
returned
No
one
has
returned
Until
my
visit
in
January
What
is
left
behind
when
you
leave
your
place
of
origin
What
is
lost
when
you
never
return
These
are
questions
I
m
trying
to
explore
with
my
parents
And
I
m
hoping
Maya
Angelou
who
grew
up
on
the
same
blood-red
Arkansas
clay
might
be
able
to
get
us
started
Should
I
read
one
of
these
poems
I
ask
Dad
s
awake
now
He
sets
his
coffee
down
while
Mom
leans
towards
the
warm
coals
It
s
called
‘
My
Arkansas
There
is
a
deep
brooding
in
Arkansas
Old
crimes
like
moss
pend
from
poplar
trees
The
sullen
earth
is
much
too
red
for
comfort
Sunrise
seems
to
hesitate
and
in
that
second
lose
its
incandescent
aim
and
dusk
no
more
shadows
than
the
noon
The
past
is
brighter
yet
Old
hates
and
ante-bellum
lace
are
rent
but
not
discarded
Today
is
yet
to
come
in
Arkansas
It
writhes
It
writhes
in
awful
waves
of
brooding
Mom
leans
back
in
her
chair
and
I
read
it
again
Today
is
yet
to
come
in
Arkansas
It
writhes
it
writhes
in
awful
waves
of
brooding
Dad
nods
his
head
in
that
knowing
way
but
none
of
us
have
the
words
to
say
more
Our
final
beech
log
collapses
into
the
coals
The
sun
climbs
above
the
hemlock
stand
Mom
asks
if
we
should
start
on
breakfast
In
the
afternoon
we
ascend
toward
Mt
Marcy
the
highest
of
the
Adirondacks
notorious
46
High
Peaks
Bright
orange
newts
dot
the
path
tall
pines
and
heritage
hardwoods
fill
the
forest
and
a
wobbly
footbridge
stretches
over
the
blue
Marcy
Brook
It
s
our
first
hike
and
Mom
s
leading
the
pack
Or
at
least
pacing
alongside
us
as
if
her
morning
California
walks
and
weekend
hikes
have
prepared
her
well
Towards
the
end
of
our
six-mile
out
and
back
we
approach
two
women
in
the
distance
walking
through
a
cluster
of
cabins
Hello
there
one
of
them
yells
out
as
if
she
hasn
t
seen
a
human
in
weeks
And
maybe
she
hasn
t
at
least
not
a
human
like
me
and
my
dad
who
are
both
black
She
s
the
campground
host
she
says
a
native
to
the
High
Peaks
As
she
talks
and
answers
all
of
my
parents
questions
about
the
Adirondacks
that
I
ve
been
unable
to
I
think
back
to
a
work
trip
I
had
here
last
year
with
the
SUNY
College
of
Environmental
Science
of
Forestry
when
we
explored
how
they
could
improve
the
number
of
people
of
color
in
their
program
We
toured
the
Ranger
School
the
oldest
continuously
operating
forest
technology
program
in
the
U.
S
At
the
time
there
was
only
one
black
student
of
the
nearly
60
enrolled
After
the
tour
I
met
Nicole
Hylton-Patterson
the
director
of
the
Adirondack
Diversity
Initiative
It
s
a
deep-rooted
problem
she
said
Rough
estimates
put
the
year-round
Adirondacks
population
somewhere
around
130,000
and
you
can
guess
how
many
of
them
are
black
she
continued
I
guessed
less
than
2
%
Probably
even
worse
she
responded
and
then
told
a
story
about
a
Go
back
sign
that
was
hung
from
a
bar
after
a
black
family
from
the
city
moved
into
a
house
across
the
street
But
they
re
talking
about
it
Nicole
said
People
are
finally
talking
about
it
And
perhaps
this
is
the
first
step
Back
at
Lake
Placid
I
try
to
take
another
step
with
my
parents
We
re
at
a
restaurant
eating
barbeque
soul
food
that
keystone
species
of
the
American
South
of
places
like
Arkansas
My
mom
is
talking
about
my
brother
s
plan
to
eventually
adopt
kids
rather
than
have
his
own
and
I
m
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
ask
about
her
own
experience
as
a
white
woman
with
black
children
without
ruining
our
dinner
What
was
it
like
for
you
Mom
having
so
many
kids
that
didn
t
exactly
look
like
you
She
looks
up
at
me
a
little
surprised
then
down
at
her
grilled
Brussels
sprouts
It
wasn
t
easy
she
says
especially
with
Karlee
who
was
the
darkest
of
us
Black
women
would
stare
at
me
in
jealousy
like
they
knew
I
had
taken
one
of
their
good
men
She
sets
her
fork
down
I
feel
something
in
my
stomach
curl
Jealousy
I
ask
reaching
for
the
baked
beans
searching
for
a
diplomacy
my
family
has
never
been
good
at
I
m
sure
it
was
probably
a
range
of
emotions
maybe
even
anger
at
Dad
She
nods
her
head
but
says
no
one
ever
looked
at
Dad
Oh
they
definitely
did
honey
he
says
leaning
over
his
collard
greens
with
wide
eyes
Eyes
that
often
say
more
than
the
rest
of
him
does
Mom
tilts
her
head
unconvinced
and
tells
us
about
two
women
who
once
stared
at
her
when
she
was
having
lunch
with
Uncle
Ricky
who
s
black
He
warned
me
they
would
stare
at
us
thinking
we
were
together
and
that
s
exactly
what
happened
I
want
my
dad
to
counter
with
his
own
story
to
prove
it
s
more
complex
than
just
jealousy
But
I
know
he
won
t
He
s
not
the
type
of
person
to
counter
He
s
not
even
the
type
of
person
who
would
think
of
this
as
something
that
needs
to
be
countered
And
he
rarely
remembers
his
own
stories
as
if
he
forgot
them
along
the
way
subconsciously
believing
there
wouldn
t
be
anyone
to
tell
them
to
But
Mom
remembers
her
stories
And
now
she
s
telling
us
about
the
time
we
went
hiking
without
Dad
and
several
white
women
told
her
how
beautiful
her
kids
were
I
got
so
mad
she
says
because
you
guys
were
a
lot
more
than
just
pretty
I
nod
but
feel
surprised
that
it
made
her
angry
I
lean
forward
to
ask
how
often
this
happened
but
she
launches
into
another
story
about
a
man
who
came
up
to
our
campground
once
when
there
were
four
of
us
kids
and
complimented
her
on
how
well-behaved
we
were
And
you
finally
have
one
that
looks
like
you
the
man
said
to
her
pointing
to
my
younger
brother
who
had
light
skin
and
blue
eyes
and
blondish
hair
Finally
I
ask
my
mom
as
the
waiter
sets
our
dinner
plates
down
Why
would
he
say
‘
finally
Did
you
know
him
before
No
no
we
never
met
She
pauses
I
guess
he
didn
t
say
finally
We
are
a
people
who
have
never
grown
old
with
our
loved
ones
There
s
no
path
that
has
been
laid
out
ahead
of
us
We
re
stumbling
forward
together
Now
I
m
the
one
with
wide
eyes
But
she
s
biting
into
her
sandwich
and
doesn
t
notice
Doesn
t
find
anything
surprising
about
this
admission
that
my
brother
who
was
by
far
the
lightest
of
us
all
was
the
kid
that
finally
looked
like
her
I
take
a
long
sip
of
my
Old-Fashioned
as
if
to
soften
all
the
things
I
want
to
say
Like
how
fucked
up
it
is
for
a
random-ass
white
dude
to
praise
a
group
of
four
black
kids
on
how
well-behaved
they
are
in
any
place
but
especially
when
camping
outdoors
Or
how
your
kids
are
so
beautiful
was
almost
definitely
soccer-mom
codeswitching
for
are
they
really
yours
Or
how
there
might
be
other
reasons
besides
Dad
being
shy
or
introverted
for
why
he
rarely
shares
his
stories
or
expresses
his
opinion
or
says
much
at
all
Internalized
and
subconscious
and
tired
age-old
reasons
But
I
don
t
say
any
of
this
I
don
t
know
how
to
say
any
of
this
Instead
I
look
out
the
glass
walls
at
the
sun
that
has
disappeared
now
Everything
is
black
And
even
though
I
can
t
see
them
I
imagine
the
millions
of
stars
shining
above
it
all
Stars
that
existed
long
before
any
of
this
Stars
that
led
thousands
through
the
dark
oceans
of
southern
wilderness
into
the
northern
plains
of
the
open
grass
valleys
that
lie
just
beyond
us
now
In
Catskill
Park
that
younger
park
sibling
made
up
of
nearly
a
million
forest
preserve
acres
a
flash
flood
warning
pops
up
on
our
phones
as
rain
falls
above
our
cabin
conjuring
memories
of
Hurricane
Ida
which
had
killed
over
50
people
in
the
Northeast
just
a
week
ago
The
storm
calms
by
morning
and
we
move
forward
with
our
plan
to
hike
a
segment
of
New
York
s
358-mile
Long
Path
towards
Kaaterskill
Falls
as
a
final
warm-up
for
the
AT
The
going
is
slow
We
navigate
through
muddy
vernal
pools
on
the
forested
shores
of
North
and
South
Lakes
through
the
satiated
oak
hickory
woods
of
Kaaterskill
wilderness
up
the
beech
roots
climbing
towards
the
top
of
South
Mountain
Mom
is
doing
good
using
the
poles
that
she
d
neglected
to
use
on
our
first
hike
Still
she
s
falling
behind
I
slow
my
pace
stopping
to
admire
makeshift
streams
falling
over
glaciated
sandstone
A
barred
owl
swoops
through
the
understory
landing
silently
on
a
hemlock
branch
We
regroup
at
the
crest
of
our
first
pass
as
the
trail
flattens
The
brush
is
thin
now
and
we
walk
together
on
top
of
a
cliff
of
sedimentary
rock
carved
out
by
a
massive
glacier
that
made
its
way
down
New
York
some
15,000
years
ago
We
step
towards
the
rock
s
edge
and
the
complete
glacial
masterpiece
appears
below
us
hundreds
of
miles
of
green
deciduous
hardwood
forest
patches
of
fields
and
pastureland
and
meadows
three
million
acres
of
the
great
Hudson
Valley
pulsing
with
the
bloodline
of
the
Hudson
River
Oh
wow
Mom
says
with
the
benevolent
sun
now
warming
her
face
I
know
right
I
ve
seen
this
masterpiece
before
but
through
my
parents
eyes
I
feel
as
if
I
m
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
We
sit
in
the
light
for
a
few
minutes
as
a
breeze
rises
from
the
Kaaterskill
gorge
below
Mom
sips
her
ice
water
Dad
reaches
into
his
secret
jelly
bean
stash
I
m
thinking
about
my
dad
s
parents
None
of
this
mattered
or
mattered
enough
He
was
still
a
black
man
As
we
continue
the
trail
is
mostly
flat
the
mountain
ridge
giving
us
a
chance
to
walk
together
before
the
ascent
ahead
I
wish
we
knew
more
stories
about
Grandpa
Benjamin
I
say
to
my
dad
as
we
pass
a
generation
of
mushrooms
fruiting
bodies
that
have
grown
out
of
a
massive
invisible
network
of
mycorrhizal
fungi
beneath
us
connecting
and
nurturing
this
entire
forest
Me
too
Benj
he
responds
But
his
dad
was
gone
so
much
he
says
for
Air
Force
assignments
in
Vietnam
and
the
Philippines
and
then
in
Okinawa
where
his
body
was
found
in
five
feet
of
water
The
forest
falls
silent
I
hear
what
I
think
is
a
sparrow
in
the
pines
above
Water
flowing
through
the
canyon
below
The
soft
soil
compressing
as
we
step
forward
He
was
the
reason
why
I
loved
the
outdoors
he
continues
walking
over
fallen
pine
needles
that
line
the
path
He
took
me
fishing
and
shooting
arrows
and
hunting
on
the
Air
Force
base
Was
he
a
good
guy
I
finally
ask
admitting
to
him
that
the
only
stories
we
heard
about
Grandpa
Benjamin
were
of
his
Playboy
magazines
and
his
diving
death
And
that
my
dad
was
never
sure
if
he
was
in
heaven
or
not
He
wasn
t
exactly
the
villain
I
say
but
he
definitely
wasn
t
the
hero
of
the
story
He
wasn
t
even
Grandpa
Benjamin
to
us
he
was
just
your
dad
I
ve
barely
even
seen
pictures
of
him
other
than
that
grainy
and
somber
black-and-white
Air
Force
portrait
Dad
lets
me
finish
and
then
stops
at
the
end
of
the
ridgeline
He
was
a
good
guy
he
says
slowly
nodding
his
head
He
drove
me
every
weekend
all
the
way
to
LA
for
wrestling
tournaments
He
worked
very
hard
And
he
loved
my
mother
very
much
Mom
agrees
with
him
He
presses
his
lips
together
leaning
slightly
into
his
hiking
poles
He
was
a
good
guy
he
says
again
I
exhale
I
think
I
needed
to
hear
that
I
say
quietly
I
think
we
all
need
to
hear
that
To
know
that
we
came
from
somewhere
that
we
came
from
someone
And
that
that
somewhere
and
someone
was
good
I
think
you
re
right
Benj
he
says
and
we
begin
to
climb
up
the
hill
I
walk
next
to
him
in
silence
thinking
of
how
Grandpa
Benjamin
died
when
Dad
was
nearly
still
a
kid
barely
20
How
Grandma
Ollie
died
a
few
years
later
in
Dad
s
late
20s
How
Dad
s
sister
his
only
sibling
died
when
he
was
in
his
early
30s
How
all
four
of
Dad
s
grandparents
died
before
they
were
able
to
see
their
children
become
adults
We
are
a
people
who
have
never
grown
old
with
our
loved
ones
There
s
no
path
that
has
been
laid
out
ahead
of
us
We
re
stumbling
forward
together

We
re
en
route
to
the
AT
and
I
ve
found
a
way
to
ask
Mom
about
her
parents
two
of
my
all-time
favorite
people
The
ones
who
helped
me
collect
sand
dollars
along
the
Pacific
and
held
my
hand
along
the
Grand
Canyon
rim
and
helped
me
search
for
Roy
Rogers
across
New
Mexico
and
never
told
me
it
was
a
crazy
idea
to
want
to
become
a
cowboy
who
lived
in
the
great
American
wilderness
But
things
weren
t
always
so
smooth
Mom
says
She
s
looking
out
our
Jeep
s
window
and
talking
quietly
which
she
rarely
does
Since
I
was
in
high
school
I
ve
always
known
that
my
grandparents
had
reservations
They
were
worried
about
how
difficult
my
life
would
be
was
always
Mom
s
narrative
But
there
s
more
she
admits
now
after
42
years
of
marriage
Nana
was
concerned
with
what
her
sorority
would
think
she
says
And
also
her
church
The
community
If
her
daughter
married
a
black
man
Even
a
black
man
their
daughter
had
been
in
school
with
since
fifth
grade
A
black
man
who
was
an
Olympic
athlete
an
aspiring
orthopedic
surgeon
in
residency
and
an
Air
Force
child
just
like
their
daughter
None
of
this
mattered
or
mattered
enough
He
was
still
a
black
man
I
squint
my
eyes
at
the
semi-truck
in
front
of
us
Everything
is
frozen
and
clear
and
full
as
if
I
m
looking
at
a
picture
of
my
life
As
if
I
can
see
all
the
way
down
Interstate
87
through
the
Catskills
and
over
the
AT
across
the
valley
and
down
through
New
York
City
all
the
way
to
where
the
Hudson
River
empties
itself
into
the
cold
and
rough
waters
of
the
Atlantic
into
the
dark
and
vast
abyss
that
my
dad
s
grandparents
grandparents
were
shipped
across
in
chains
and
shackles
I
should
be
shocked
At
least
in
denial
But
I
m
none
of
these
things
I
m
not
even
surprised
Somehow
I
knew
Somehow
I
ve
always
known
Although
I
don
t
know
how
There
was
barely
time
to
breathe
let
alone
to
breach
the
questions
I
ve
been
waiting
to
ask
Questions
about
race
ancestors
belonging
place
Questions
we
ve
avoided
all
of
my
life
Here
s
what
I
do
know
That
when
I
was
in
junior
high
misbehaving
in
the
ways
that
junior
highers
misbehave
my
mom
said
that
my
dreads
were
the
reason
I
had
a
bad
attitude
and
cut
them
off
That
when
I
was
in
high
school
my
mom
confiscated
my
hip
hop
collection
and
cut
the
uncensored
CDs
in
half
That
since
I
was
in
college
there
have
been
all
types
of
black
shows
and
documentaries
including
a
Broadway
play
this
past
weekend
that
we
won
t
watch
because
they
re
just
too
much
for
my
mom
But
here
s
what
else
I
know
That
when
my
elementary
school
decided
not
to
give
us
MLK
Day
off
one
year
Mom
took
us
out
of
school
anyway
That
even
though
I
only
had
one
set
of
black
cousins
Mom
made
sure
I
went
to
their
house
every
summer
in
Texas
so
I
could
be
with
them
That
even
though
there
was
only
one
black
woman
in
our
church
Mom
made
sure
to
invite
her
and
her
daughter
over
for
Thanksgiving
and
Easter
and
birthdays
and
Sunday
brunches
Which
is
to
say
that
we
didn
t
always
get
it
right
That
Mom
and
Dad
didn
t
get
it
right
But
also
to
say
that
they
tried
That
we
tried
And
that
we
still
made
it
pretty
far
given
everything
I
m
learning
that
we
started
with
the
sororities
and
the
churches
and
the
communities
and
the
backgammon
clubs
The
odds
were
against
us
We
were
never
going
to
win
But
we
still
made
it
pretty
far
Which
is
more
than
we
can
say
for
the
AT
as
Dad
and
I
look
out
from
the
top
of
the
pass
and
realize
we
re
not
actually
at
the
summit
We
re
at
a
false
peak
The
real
summit
is
still
miles
ahead
Mom
is
barely
in
sight
now
Perhaps
it
was
our
discussion
Or
her
hip
is
worse
than
she
s
letting
on
Whatever
it
is
the
AT
isn
t
going
to
be
the
mountaintop
experience
I
was
building
it
up
to
be
I
think
we
should
turn
around
I
say
Dad
nods
his
head
and
we
wait
for
Mom
who
is
unmoved
by
the
announcement
And
then
suggests
we
take
a
selfie
As
we
head
back
I
think
about
all
the
potential
the
AT
holds
and
how
little
of
it
we
re
realizing
2,190
miles
connecting
disparate
parts
of
the
country
the
Northeast
and
the
American
South
with
its
scars
from
slavery
and
sharecropping
and
unfulfilled
reparations
and
white
supremacy
and
economic
deprivation
but
also
its
rich
black
history
and
culture
and
folklore
and
poetry
and
soul
food
and
land
Especially
its
land
Did
I
think
the
AT
could
connect
these
disparate
parts
of
my
life
The
Midwestern
homes
my
parents
left
as
children
and
the
Southern
home
my
paternal
grandparents
never
returned
to
as
adults
The
biracial
black
family
my
maternal
grandma
pushed
against
and
the
Sierra
Nevada
home
I
now
live
3,000
miles
away
from
Maybe
I
did
But
we
re
only
walking
a
tiny
portion
of
it
Even
if
you
count
the
miles
we
hiked
upstate
that
s
still
less
than
1
%
of
the
AT
How
much
progress
could
I
really
have
expected
to
make
What
is
left
behind
when
you
leave
your
place
of
origin
What
is
lost
when
you
never
return
These
are
questions
I
m
trying
to
explore
with
my
parents
After
a
few
minutes
I
pass
the
two
Latina
women
who
are
further
behind
than
I
expected
and
we
exchange
smiles
We
re
inching
our
way
ahead
one
of
them
says
You
re
doing
great
I
say
On
the
final
descent
where
the
AT
folds
into
switchbacks
a
pain
shoots
up
my
left
knee
through
my
IT
band
and
into
my
left
glute
It
s
a
familiar
pain
one
that
I
ve
been
running
away
from
quite
literally
for
years
When
I
turn
the
corner
and
it
jolts
up
again
I
wonder
if
this
isn
t
why
I
ve
been
so
impatient
with
my
mom
the
person
I
most
want
to
be
patient
with
even
as
I
cheerlead
for
two
strangers
on
this
trail
Because
Mom
s
struggles
say
something
about
me
Her
mortality
is
a
reflection
a
glimpse
into
my
own
And
as
I
reach
the
next
switchback
I
realize
her
whiteness
is
also
my
own
whiteness
at
least
in
part
Her
unreconciled
or
ignored
racial
past
has
now
become
my
own
to
carry
I
look
back
at
Dad
who
is
now
a
few
switchbacks
behind
me
adjusting
the
straps
on
his
backpack
as
he
rounds
the
corner
He
has
spent
his
whole
life
trying
to
climb
above
this
racial
past
not
ignoring
it
completely
but
turning
the
other
cheek
It
was
what
he
needed
to
do
to
survive
which
has
inadvertently
left
behind
mounds
of
unprocessed
discrimination
and
racism
All
the
conversations
he
never
had
the
anger
he
never
expressed
the
sadness
he
never
showed
are
now
my
weight
to
carry
and
unpack
I
exhale
as
I
round
the
last
switchback
I
see
our
Jeep
The
trail
is
flat
and
the
pain
in
my
leg
is
gone
for
now
Our
Williams-family-debut-AT-hike
is
almost
finished
And
yet
there
are
nearly
1,500
miles
of
trail
still
ahead
all
the
way
down
to
Georgia
towards
the
direction
where
my
grandparents
were
born
and
the
place
they
ultimately
fled
And
there
are
nearly
700
miles
of
trail
behind
us
all
the
way
up
to
Maine
My
parents
are
still
behind
me
and
I
know
that
in
some
ways
they
ll
never
catch
up
The
work
is
on
me
now
They
ve
already
given
me
enough
these
legs
and
shoulders
and
eyes
And
the
determination
to
figure
it
out
the
strength
to
keep
going
the
attention
to
delight
in
everything
around
me
the
warmth
of
the
sun
against
my
exposed
forehead
the
sound
of
rustling
beech
leaves
above
the
padding
of
red-clay
maple
leaves
underneath
me
as
I
approach
the
end
of
the
path

Something
odd
happened
to
my
clothes
during
the
pandemic
Without
meaning
to
I
amassed
a
wardrobe
with
a
palette
ranging
from
cremini
mushroom
to
a
particular
purplish-gray
an
unfortunate
shade
that
reminds
me
of
used
chewing
gum
This
summer
I
splurged
on
a
tangerine
house
dress
but
it
never
left
my
closet
Cheery
colors
don
t
feel
right
After
skimming
through
highlights
from
New
York
Fashion
Week
it
s
clear
that
my
attraction
to
mud-
and
fungi-inspired
styles
isn
t
just
a
private
mood
This
mushroom
theme
is
everywhere
loose
grays
and
browns
giant
scarves
that
cover
mouths
and
noses
and
bucket
hats
that
shield
the
eyes
Even
cottagecore
possibly
the
defining
social
media
aesthetic
of
the
early
pandemic
is
giving
way
to
earthier
goblincore
looks
Obviously
mud
and
mushrooms
aren
t
the
only
things
happening
in
fashion
right
now
But
if
a
lot
of
us
are
dressing
this
way
there
must
be
good
reasons
why
Here
s
one
possible
explanation
As
we
settle
into
a
new
decade
there
is
more
confusion
than
usual
around
what
we
should
be
wearing
how
we
should
be
buying
it
and
what
we
should
care
about
After
two
years
in
stretchy
fabrics
we
re
supposed
to
get
back
outside
and
look
presentable
but
it
s
unclear
what
that
means
Do
we
invest
in
a
capsule
wardrobe
or
revel
in
secondhand
maximalism
Is
it
time
we
end
our
collective
habit
of
fast
fashion
With
so
much
strife
and
uncertainty
in
the
world
it
s
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
and
say
that
clothes
don
t
even
matter
But
they
do
Getting
dressed
isn
t
a
low-stakes
activity
nor
is
it
something
we
can
opt
out
of
After
all
we
have
bodies
Our
appearances
are
read
according
to
cultural
norms
and
expectations
Clothes
too
reflect
a
vibe
the
culture
of
a
moment
they
define
generations
And
fashion
is
always
political
even
something
as
excessively
innocent
as
twee
has
a
radical
history
What
s
more
fashion
is
a
global
industry
that
provides
millions
of
jobs
to
workers
around
the
world
And
for
good
ill
and
everything
in
between
fashion
and
adornment
are
our
history
Thinking
about
all
of
this
can
be
exhausting
making
us
want
to
retreat
under
the
cover
of
our
bucket
hats
I
ve
spent
almost
20
years
studying
teaching
and
writing
about
clothes
I
never
tire
of
the
subject
Our
relationship
with
clothing
is
complicated
and
fashion
is
endlessly
fascinating
with
its
unique
ability
to
cut
across
and
connect
every
aspect
of
daily
life
tied
to
the
global
economy
weaved
into
our
personal
memories
I
think
there
s
another
way
to
look
at
this
mushroom
moment
If
this
is
an
era
of
murkiness
and
uncertainty
let
it
also
be
a
time
of
reflection
learning
and
unlearning
and
a
deeper
understanding
of
our
individual
and
collective
experiences
through
fashion
The
essays
I
ve
compiled
in
this
reading
list
are
part
of
that
process
They
help
me
put
my
current
tastes
into
perspective
reflect
on
the
big
picture
and
remember
that
what
I
choose
to
wear
is
just
one
part
of
getting
dressed
Maybe
soon
I
ll
be
ready
for
that
tangerine
dress
Why
do
legacy
brands
have
such
a
terrible
track
record
when
it
comes
to
acknowledging
the
ugly
parts
of
their
histories
So
many
storied
European
fashion
brands
have
had
connections
to
fascism
it
s
hard
to
keep
them
straight
Coco
Chanel
Nazi
Hugo
Boss
Nazi
Adidas
and
Puma
Created
by
German
brothers
both
Nazis
To
my
knowledge
only
Hugo
Boss
has
formally
apologized
for
this
past
Other
brands
continue
to
offer
platitudes
and
ask
that
we
focus
on
what
their
values
are
today
For
companies
whose
brands
are
built
around
their
history
like
Brooks
Brothers
the
disconnect
is
absurd
According
to
Jonathan
Michael
Square
the
apparel
brand
s
history
dating
back
to
its
founding
in
1818
includes
selling
clothes
to
be
worn
by
enslaved
men
in
the
South
Square
s
research
draws
mainly
from
museum
collections
and
historical
societies
As
Square
notes
Brooks
Brothers
keeps
their
own
archives
locked
missing
a
major
opportunity
to
change
their
history
by
adding
a
meaningful
contribution
to
an
urgent
conversation
While
many
others
American
corporations
and
families
have
roots
in
American
slavery
few
have
maintained
a
continuous
brand
identity
over
two
centuries
Brooks
Brothers
has
survived
in
part
due
to
the
glacial
shifts
in
menswear
trends
that
protect
it
from
the
vagaries
of
a
mercurial
fashion
industry
In
one
of
her
most
famous
quotes
postcolonial
theorist
Gayatri
Spivak
described
the
historic
justification
of
colonialism
as
white
men
saving
brown
women
from
brown
men
Rafia
Zakaria
s
essay
for
Aeon
shows
the
role
that
women
s
clothing
has
played
in
that
narrative
British
colonizers
in
India
wanted
saris
to
conform
to
their
ideas
of
modesty
Over
a
century
later
Americans
declared
their
goal
of
liberating
Afghan
women
from
the
burka
As
Zakaria
points
out
both
campaigns
made
for
titillating
stories
that
cast
invading
armies
as
heroes
and
entire
nations
of
women
as
exotically
clad
damsels
in
distress
As
the
fallout
from
America
s
occupation
of
Afghanistan
continues
it
s
worth
remembering
that
these
stories
haven
t
had
any
demonstrable
impact
on
the
lives
of
the
women
they
were
supposed
to
be
helping
Whether
it
is
the
covering
of
breasts
in
Southern
India
or
the
wearing
of
burqas
in
Afghanistan
women
s
comportment
and
clothing
have
offered
an
emotionally
powerful
shorthand
for
all
that
is
wrong
with
native
culture
and
all
that
must
be
corrected
by
the
empire
The
pandemic
forced
many
of
us
to
pay
more
attention
to
supply
chains
We
re
waiting
longer
for
clothes
ordered
online
to
be
delivered
Brick-and-mortar
stores
are
an
entirely
different
story
The
last
time
I
wandered
into
a
Nordstrom
there
was
an
air
of
desolation
in
the
women
s
section
Bored
sales
associates
refolded
acrylic
cardigans
on
a
half-empty
table
and
whispered
to
each
other
over
a
lonely
rack
of
Not
Your
Daughter
s
Jeans
more
on
the
state
of
department
stores
below
But
in
the
fashion
industry
the
people
most
impacted
by
COVID
s
disruptions
are
the
ones
who
make
our
clothes
As
usual
the
most
precarious
workers
endure
the
worst
consequences
This
piece
by
Amna
Chaudry
is
remarkable
for
the
way
it
centers
workers
perspectives
and
highlights
their
organizing
So
much
fashion
journalism
perpetuates
the
idea
that
garment
workers
are
an
exploited
mass
who
either
can
t
do
better
or
need
rescuing
But
if
we
really
want
to
change
the
global
fashion
industry
we
have
to
knock
that
off
and
listen
to
garment
workers
The
video
is
shaky
taken
by
someone
who
doesn
t
want
to
be
caught
by
the
floor
manager
It
pans
the
factory
floor
taking
in
the
men
and
women
who
are
looking
at
one
another
and
waiting
for
someone
to
begin
Someone
picks
up
a
metal
spool
and
clangs
it
against
the
table
One
by
one
each
worker
follows
suit
We
are
protesting
today
against
the
non-payment
of
our
salaries
a
voice
says
into
the
camera
Last
November
I
took
my
cultural
studies
class
on
a
field
trip
to
the
Lloyd
Center
a
classic
mid-century
American
mall
in
Portland
Oregon
Even
though
I
grew
up
five
hours
away
I
have
many
memories
of
holiday
visits
to
this
magical
place
In
my
mind
s
eye
the
Lloyd
is
packed
with
people
in
shops
gazing
at
animatronic
elves
nibbling
Hickory
Farms
samples
and
enjoying
its
centerpiece
the
ice
skating
rink
In
2021
while
my
students
bought
Auntie
Anne
s
pretzels
I
leaned
on
the
railing
overlooking
the
ice
A
single
skater
was

figure-eights
in

of
a
boarded-up

A
week
later

announced
that

was
facing

In
this
piece
Jason
Del
Rey
teases
out
the
intertwining
threads
of
department

and

to
explain

This
piece
by
Tabitha
Blankenbiller
takes
us
on
a
ride
through
the
complicated
pleasure
of
a
single
dress
Blankenbiller
describes
herself
as
Daria
to
her
sister
s
Quinn
She
is
decidedly
not
a
Las
Vegas-body-con-dress-and-bottle-service-at-the-club
type
The
pleasure
here
isn
t
of
the
I
suddenly
saw
myself
as
sexy
makeover
movie
variety
Instead
the
dress
facilitates
a
shift
in
her
relationship
with
her
sister
and
the
stories
Blankenbiller
tells
about
herself
and
it
allows
her
to
enjoy
a
weird
glimpse
into
a
different
world
It
s
as
much
fun
to
read
as
it
seems
like
the
dress
was
to
wear
I
d
tried
my
best
to
pack
for
my
sister
Emma
s
bachelorette
party
I
d
combed
through
my
huge
collection
of
dresses
mostly
vintage-inspired
circle
skirts
with
whimsical
prints
and
sent
her
pictures
of
the
lowest-cut
shortest
options
Those
are
really
cute
she
wrote
back
but
do
you
have
anything
like
skankier
I
always
love
writing
that
conveys
the
physicality
of
dress
and
adornment
It
s
much
easier
to
express
in
words
how
clothes
look
than
how
they
feel
I
m
also
obsessed
with
clothing
s
time-traveling
powers
how
it
connects
our
bodies
to
the
bodies
of
people
who
have
come
before
us
Jewelry
being
less
vulnerable
to
the
passage
of
time
than
textiles
has
a
special
ability
to
carry
generations
of
experience
as
it
s
passed
along
Agnes
Tran
s
essay
is
in
part
about
a
jade
bracelet
that
holds
all
of
these
connections
It
s
also
about
her
grandmother
and
navigating
life
as
a
Vietnamese
American
Tran
s
words
conjured
the
weight
of
a
jade
band
as
it
scraped
across
her
knuckles
so
lovingly
and
viscerally
I
found
myself
rubbing
my
own
hands
as
I
read
Sitting
on
the
white
tiles
of
my
aunt
s
kitchen
in
Saigon
my
aunt
and
mother
would
soap
down
my
left
hand
preparing
my
skin
for
the
pain
My
mother
would
squeeze
my
hand
down
until
my
thumb
would
press
against
the
middle
of
my
other
fingers
Their
hands
would
begin
to
drag
the
band
down
The
jade
would
pass
over
my
fingertips
and
then
my
joints
and
then
over
my
knuckles
before
it
would
begin
to
scrape
against
my
skin
Their
hands
would
be
gentle
but
steady
unforgiving
resolute
The
pain
would
be
white
but
impermanent
A
fashion
scholar
friend
of
mine
once
quipped
that
the
main
service
Goodwill
provides
is
easing
the
conscience
of
North
American
shoppers
They
make
our
old
stuff
disappear
so
we
don
t
have
to
think
about
it
anymore
The
comment
stuck
with
me
because
I
m
absolutely
guilty
of
partaking
in
this
service
I
do
it
despite
knowing
that
Goodwill
does
not
do
good
by
their
disabled
workers
and
that
most
of
their
clothing
donations
will
eventually
find
their
way
to
secondhand
markets
and
landfills
in
the
Global
South
Goodwill
is
a
massive
organization
but
it
s
just
one
piece
of
a
bigger
problem
If
we
are
going
to
make
fashion
better
it
s
important
to
understand
the
long
afterlives
of
our
clothes
As
Ryan
Lenora
Brown
points
out
the
ever-increasing
speed
of
fashion
production
paired
with
declining
quality
has
created
a
crisis
in
African
countries
that
have
been
the
recipients
of
our
castoffs
Each
day
about
154,000
pounds
of
used
clothing

Brendan
O
Meara
is
no
stranger
to
talking
about
the
art
and
craft
of
storytelling
Moving
forward
we
ll
be
featuring
craft-focused
excerpts
of
some
of
his
episodes
starting
with
last
week
s
Episode
304
in
which
he
interviewed
Atavist
editor
Jonah
Ogles
and
writer
Bill
Donahue
about
their
work
on
the
latest
issue
of
The
Atavist
One
of
the
many
great
pleasures
of
interviewing
badass
people
about
the
art
and
craft
of
telling
true
stories
is
the
opportunity
to
hop
in
the
gondola
of
someone
s
brain
And
sometimes
as
in
the
latest
episode
of
The
Creative

Bill
Donahue
is
a
journalist
whose
work
has
appeared
in
the
New
York
Times
Magazine
Outside
Washington
Post
Magazine
and
several
other
places
His
February
Atavist
piece
The
Voyagers
chronicles
the
harrowing
journey
of
a
Ukrainian
father
and
son
Valeri
and
Oleg
Minakov
defecting
to
Alaska
in
a
homemade
kayak
in
1945
As
Bill
says
It
s
a
voyage
across
the
Bering
Strait
but
also
a
voyage
across
the
landscape
of
the
Cold
War
and
what
the
Cold
War
did
to
these
two
people
In
this
conversation
Bill
talks
about
navigating
the
tension
of
writing
about
someone
honestly
while
also
becoming
friendly
with
them
something
many
longform
journalists
and
profile
writers
can
relate
to
He
also
talks
about
making
sure
stories
don
t
get
too
bogged
down
with
backstory
and
how
ultimately
we
as
people
are
made
of
stories
and
each
one
of
us
has
a
story
that
wants
to
be
told
In
the
first
part
of
the
episode
I
spoke
with
Jonah
Ogles
the
lead
editor
of
this
piece
who
discussed
how
an
editor
navigates
how
to
get
a
piece
to
that
good
place
which
is
the
goal
for
any
writer/editor
relationship
Writers
and
editors
can
each
glean
much
insight
from
their
counterparts
in
the
editorial
dynamic
and
so
I
hope
you
enjoy
reading
these
excerpts
and
listening
to
the
episode
in
full
below
These
interviews
have
been
lightly
edited
for
clarity
and
concision
CNF
When
you
were
reading
this
piece
and
editing
it
what
did
it
remind
you
of
structurally
and
thematically
whether
that
be
other
magazine
pieces
or
books
or
even
movies
Jonah
Ogles
Nothing
in
pop
culture
immediately
stands
out
to
me
Bill
is
one
of
the
all-time
great
profile
writers
He
s
just
so
good
at
it
I
mean
the
guy
has
made
me
cry
before
when
reading
pieces
of
his
not
necessarily
that
I
ve
worked
on
And
so
as
I
was
working
on
the
piece
I
was
just
trying
to
push
it
toward
that
good
place
that
he
can
get
to
as
a
writer
It
feels
a
little
bit
silly
to
even
say
that
I
m
trying
to
help
him
do
that
because
I
think
he
basically
just
does
that
he
could
probably
be
edited
by
like
an
AI
computer
That
s
pretty
good
Try
to
make
it
better
this
time
And
then
in
three
drafts
he
d
have
something
amazing
But
that
s
what
was
in
my
mind
Okay
I
ve
got
this
great
writer
I
ve
got
this
great
story
What
questions
do
I
need
to
ask
in
order
to
get
this
to
be
the
best
piece
it
can
be
How
long
does
it
take
you
to
feel
out
each
writer
and
realize
one
might
need
more
nudging
or
another
just
needs
a
simple
keep
going
versus
other
ones
who
might
need
more
hands-on/hands-off
[
approaches
]
How
long
does
it
take
you
to
gauge
that
with
each
writer
It
comes
pretty
quickly
after
the
first
revision
I
can
be
a
fairly
clumsy
editor
and
a
lot
of
times
my
first
memo
is
just
a
throw-it-all-at-the-wall
type
of
memo
You
know
like
here
s
virtually
every
thought
I
had
while
reading
this
piece
And
sometimes
that
prompts
a
conversation
Sometimes
the
writer
just
says
thanks
When
I
get
the
next
revision
back
that
s
when
I
know
okay
this
writer
is
either
able
to
take
even
slightly
confusing
comments
that
I
ve
made
and
distill
them
and
apply
them
to
the
work
to
make
it
better
Sometimes
it
reveals
that
something
I
had
flagged
as
not
working
is
still
not
working
but
a
bunch
of
other
things
are
working
or
have
improved
Then
I
think
okay
maybe
this
is
just
the
section
that
s
going
to
give
us
a
lot
of
trouble
But
then
there
are
writers
who
seem
to
have
missed
it
That
sounds
dismissive
or
condescending
and
I
don
t
mean
it
to
I
think
sometimes
writers
are
just
too
close
to
a
story
and
even
when
you
say
Hey
here
s
a
bunch
of
thoughts
that
I
had
that
doesn
t
give
them
the
distance
they
need
to
really
engage
with
a
piece
That
s
when
I
sort
of
kick
in
and
say
Okay
maybe
I
ll
give
them
a
structure
or
maybe
I
ll
rewrite
the
500
words
that
I
think
are
most
problematic
or
maybe
I
ll
just
go
to
Seyward
[
Darby
editor-in-chief
of
The
Atavist
]
and
be
like
I
don
t
know
how
to
help
here
what
tricks
do
you
have
And
then
we
start
trying
other
more
pointed
ways
of
editing
to
help
provide
that
distance
for
them
Maybe
a
writer
keeps
missing
the
mark
What
do
you
do
in
the
event
where
they
re
saying
No
you
re
missing
the
mark
You
all
want
to
get
to
the
same
spot
but
maybe
there
s
some
friction
there
that
is
hard
to
overcome
I
ve
had
that
happen
a
fair
bit
If
Bill
had
said
hey
I
don
t
want
to
write
anything
about
the
Bering
Strait
because
I
m
not
interested
in
the
adventure
stuff
maybe
there
would
have
been
some
conflict
there
But
more
often
when
a
writer
comes
to
me
and
says
that
they
re
thinking
about
the
piece
in
a
different
way
than
I
am
it
allows
me
to
see
the
story
in
a
different
light
I
m
just
a
reader
A
story
shows
up
I
start
reading
the
first
sentence
with
all
my
own
preconceived
notions
and
every
other
piece
of
writing
that
I
ve
ever
read
in
my
head
and
my
brain
starts
doing
its
own
thing
to
each
piece
it
reads
I
hope
that
it
s
fairly
open-minded
but
still
I
would
guess
that
very
quickly
my
brain
starts
okay
this
is
my
adventure
narrative
Let
s
start
shaping
it
into
that
Leah
Sottile
also
hosted
and
reported
Bundyville
a
podcast
from
Longreads
in
partnership
with
Oregon
Public
Broadcasting
As
an
example
Leah
Sottile
wrote
a
piece
for
me
and
I
sent
her
some
notes
And
she
came
back
to
me
and
said
That
all
makes
sense
but
here
s
what
I
m
trying
to
do
And
it
seems
like
that
s
not
really
coming
across
And
that
allowed
us
to
really
sit
back
and
go
oh
there
s
this
whole
other
thing
we
can
try
here
I
know
writers
worry
about
this
a
lot
when
they
feel
like
an
editor
is
not
on
the
same
page
But
it
s
almost
like
couples
therapy
If
you
could
sit
down
and
talk
about
it
nonjudgmentally
those
conversations
inevitably
make
a
piece
much
much
better
You
mentioned
earlier
how
great
of
a
profile
writer
Bill
is
Given
your
experience
editing
and
of
course
reading
what
is
it
about
a
character-driven
profile
that
really
hums
It
s
a
word
I
m
using
a
lot
in
this
interview
but
there
s
an
emotional
resonance
to
my
favorite
profiles
This
is
why
celebrity
profiles
so
often
fall
flat
the
subjects
themselves
are
very
guarded
individuals
and
very
practiced
And
so
I
think
for
writers
what
it
takes
is
spending
a
lot
of
time
with
someone
establishing
a
rapport
and
a
connection
caring
about
their
subject
and
then
being
able
to
get
that
all
onto
the
page
in
a
way
that
allows
readers
to
walk
through
that
door
and
have
an
open
connection
that
the
writer
has
established
with
the
subject
CNF
You
bring
a
wonderful
storytelling
touch
to
the
nonfiction
you
do
especially
with
this
piece
that
you
did
for
The
Atavist
which
was
a
really
gripping
read
Often
when
I
read
things
of
this
length
it
takes
me
a
few
breaks
but
I
found
myself
reading
this
straight
through
beginning
to
end
It
was
a
wonderful
story
How
did
you
arrive
at
the
story
of
Valeri
and
Oleg
Bill
Donahue
I
just
happened
to
be
reading
a
1988
article
that
appeared
in
the
New
York
Times
Magazine
called
Lifting
The
Ice
Curtain
and
it
made
a
one-paragraph
mention
to
their
expedition
And
I
was
just
like
Oh
my
God
this
is
an
incredible
story
Right
away
I
started
doing
the
math
I
m
like
okay
Oleg
Minakov
was
six
in
1945
how
old
would
he
be
now
Maybe
he
s
still
alive
I
started
Googling
and
found
some
guy
with
that
name
who
in
1969
was
living
at
this
commune
and
he
was
arrested
on
drug
charges
and
he
lives
in
California
I
made
a
bunch
of
calls
emails
whatever
to
people
who
were
related
to
him
And
sure
enough
his
son
got
back
to
me
and
said
Yeah
he
s
still
alive
And
here
s
a
picture
of
the
compass
that
they
used
to
cross
the
Bering
Strait
He
sent
that
to
me
as
a
text
Wow
So
you
find
that
he
s
alive
what
is
the
process
by
which
you
go
on
the
manhunt
if
you
will
to
find
him
And
then
once
you
do
how
do
you
lobby
the
son
how
do
you
ingratiate
yourself
into
their
trust
Well
the
search
was
fairly
basic
just
a
lot
of
Googling
and
a
little
bit
of
fuzzy
logic
but
not
too
much
In
this
case
Oleg
Minakov
is
a
very
uncommon
name
It
so
happens
that
it
s
also
the
name
of
some
hockey
player
but
that
guy
was
way
way
younger
As
far
as
getting
access
winning
people
s
trust
is
definitely
a
part
of
journalism
In
this
case
these
people
were
just
overjoyed
that
I
had
come
along
here
s
a
guy
who
his
whole
life
had
wanted
the
story
to
be
told
So
I
was
very
sweetly
ushered
in
in
a
way
that
I
didn
t
have
to
do
a
lot
of
conniving
to
get
access
The
piece
has
a
three-part
structure
The
first
part
which
has
this
really
harrowing
journey
across
the
Bering
Strait
in
a
makeshift
kayak
is
incredible
just
to
visualize
but
that
first
part
is
his
half
of
the
entire
[
story
]
then
there
are
two
other
parts
afterwards
Maybe
you
can
speak
to
the
structure
of
the
piece
and
how
you
weighted
certain
elements
of
the
story
I
conceived
of
this
all
along
as
a
voyage
across
the
Bering
Strait
But
it
s
also
sort
of
a
voyage
across
the
landscape
of
the
Cold
War
and
what
the
Cold
War
did
to
these
two
people
In
that
respect
the
voyage
is
only
the
first
part
of
it
And
in
fact
the
first
section
doesn
t
consist
solely
of
the
voyage
It
consists
of
a
lot
of
backstory
because
they
didn
t
just
casually
dip
their
toes
in
the
Bering
Strait
I
mean
they
did
that
for
a
very
explicit
reason
Valeri
Minakov
was
egregiously
persecuted
in
the
Soviet
Union
going
back
to
[
the
fact
that
]
he
was
a
native
of
Ukraine
Just
as
right
now
Russia
regarded
that
as
their
pawn
specifically
Starting
with
Lenin
they
tried
to
seize
the
grain
from
Ukraine
and
send
it
around
throughout
the
Soviet
Union
That
came
down
very
hard
on
Valeri
s
parents
because
they
were
farmers
and
were
politically
under
siege
for
most
of
his
life
In
your
experience
how
have
you
been
able
to
navigate
the
amount
of
backstory
that
s
germane
to
the
forward
propulsion
of
the
story
and
not
weigh
down
too
much
despite
all
the
research
and
reporting
you
do
Well
in
my
case
that
usually
comes
down
to
me
writing
10,000
words
and
then
the
editor
saying
Well
this
is
kind
of
interesting
but
let
s
trim
it
back
to
like
1,000
Oh
no
The
ratio
wasn
t
that
extreme
in
this
case
but
you
know
the
impulse
of
writers
is
to
go
down
the
rabbit
hole
a
little
bit
There
s
always
a
balance
that
you
have
to
strike
in
telling
a
story
You
can
t
digress
so
deeply
into
the
backstory
that
you
lose
sight
of
the
front
story
And
that
is
where
a
deft
editor
comes
in
And
in
this
case
it
was
a
matter
more
of
restructuring
things
putting
things
in
a
different
order
so
that
you
wouldn
t
feel
drowned
in
the
backstory
How
did
you
navigate
reporting
and
interviewing
about
the
relationship
he
had
with
his
father
The
question
of
his
father
was
just
incredibly
in
the
forefront
of
his
mind
even
though
his
father
died
in
1967
It
was
still
an
unresolved
issue
for
him
He
was
staying
at
this
hotel
when
I
interviewed
him
I
interviewed
him
until
late
in
the
evening
And
then
I
went
to
leave
the
room
and
he
said
Turn
the
TV
on
If
it
s
not
on
I
think
about
my
dad
and
why
I
never
got
him
out
of
the
mental
institution
So
it
was
right
there
in
the
forefront
you
know
I
had
supporting
documents
to
sort
of
guide
my
questioning
but
he
was
not
reluctant
to
speak
about
it
I
understand
it
was
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
procure
those
documents
to
write
The
FBI
extensively
interviewed
and
tracked
Valeri
I
think
it
was
about
400
pages
of
notes
on
the
medicals
lodged
at
the
National
Archives
Especially
with
COVID
I
got
the
runaround
from
them
forever
you
just
felt
like
you
re
communicating
with
a
brick
wall
Finally
they
just
said
You
can
come
and
get
these
documents
And
then
it
was
just
smooth
as
silk
from
there
We
also
got
Valeri
s
psychiatric
records
He
was
in
a
mental
institution
with
paranoid
schizophrenia
from
1950
to
1967
and
Oleg
signed
on
he
was
next
of
kin
and
he
was
able
to
help
me
get
access
When
you
re
writing
about
someone
like
Oleg
people
who
let
you
into
their
lives
you
re
essentially
trusted
to
interview
them
with
care
and
tell
their
story
and
you
come
to
care
about
these
people
But
you
also
as
a
journalist
have
to
tell
a
fair
and
honest
story
So
I
m
curious
how
you
navigate
that
Well
yeah
that
s
an
interesting
question
I
mean
I
found
Oleg
to
be
an
infinitely
infinitely
likable
guy
People
were
quoted
as
saying
he
has
no
guile
or
malice
for
anybody
But
he
does
have
some
dark
stripes
on
his
record
I
mean
he
went
to
prison
for
dealing
acid
in
the
90s
and
that
caused
misery
in
the
lives
of
the
people
around
him
he
had
an
8-year-old
son
at
the
time
So
I
included
that
in
the
story
He
stole
a
car
in
the
50s
when
he
was
a
teenager
I
don
t
think
that
s
a
significant
thing
that
he
did
but
I
did
try
to
present
a
comprehensive
picture
of
him
That
s
certainly
an
ethical
challenge
with
journalism
But
you
know
the
things
that
Oleg
did
weren
t
evil
they
were
stupid
There
s
a
big
difference
So
I
didn
t
see
him
as
a
morally
complex
character

The
Voyagers
at
The
Atavist
now
By
Cecilia
Gigliotti
In
the
dregs
of
the
dismal
winter
of
2021
approaching
the
anniversary
of
the
first
COVID
lockdown
I
had
the
idea
to
start
a
podcast
about
Pet
Sounds
the
Beach
Boys
belatedly
acclaimed
1966
orchestral-pop
record
At
my
family
s
vehement
recommendation
I
d
just
seen
the
2014
biopic
Love
and
Mercy
part
of
which
mythologizes
the
album
s
genesis
I
was
also
listening
to
the
album
itself
a
lot
because
I
ve
done
that
since
becoming
a
Serious
Music
Critic
at
age
13
specifically
a
Serious
Critic
of
Any
Music
Tangential
to
the
Beatles
But
the
album
was
a
fixture
in
my
life
before
then
watching
the
film
I
realized
I
could
sing
every
note
vocal
and
instrumental
And
the
pandemic
had
supplied
me
with
the
time
and
energy
to
create
the
kind
of
podcast
I
d
spent
the
last
couple
of
years
fantasizing
about
Thence
was
born
Pod
Sounds
Confident
as
I
was
in
my
ability
to
perform
a
season
s
worth
of
compositional
and
lyrical
analysis
I
knew
I
would
need
to
research
to
fill
in
my
understanding
of
the
band
s
peculiar
dynamic
and
of
its
mixed-up
maestro
Brian
Wilson
with
whom
Pet
Sounds
is
synonymous
What
I
unearthed
over
the
course
of
that
first
season
gave
me
the
sense
as
a
good
education
does
that
there
was
more
to
know
than
I
could
ever
learn
And
the
more
I
learned
about
how
much
there
was
left
to
learn
the
more
worthwhile
the
whole
undertaking
became
Even
after
wrapping
the
season
I
keep
happening
upon
more
writing
It
turns
out
almost
everybody
has
an
opinion
on
Wilson
s
supposed
genius
or
on
Pet
Sounds
as
evidence
of
it
or
both
That
people
have
not
stopped
generating
literature
and
ancillary
art
in
response
to
Wilson
and
his
masterstroke
speaks
to
the
sustained
relevance
of
his
contributions
to
pop
music
and
its
environs
With
the
artist
s
80th
birthday
approaching
in
June
here
is
a
sampling
of
such
reflections
Wong
occasioned
by
the
release
of
the
2021
documentary
Brian
Wilson
Long
Promised
Road
parses
the
myth
shrouding
the
bandmates
creative
partnership
of
which
he
feels
Wilson
is
generally
assigned
too
large
a
percentage
He
not
only
provides
context
for
many
of
the
band
s
best-known
and
least-known
works
Caroline
No
from
Pet
Sounds
was
released
on
Capitol
Records
under
Brian
Wilson
rather
than
The
Beach
Boys
but
also
assesses
the
often
distorting
effect
that
the
cumulative
story
has
on
our
impressions
of
Wilson
versus
the
rest
of
the
family
As
part
of
the
HBR
s
Life
s
Work
interview
series
Beard
talked
with
Wilson
to
commemorate
the
release
of
his
autobiography
I
Am
Brian
Wilson
The
conversation
ranges
from
the
unique
pros
and
cons
of
a
family-band
relationship
to
the
lessons
Wilson
has
learned
from
the
various
lyricists
with
whom
he
s
collaborated
over
a
decades-long
career
Wilson
also
reflects
on
various
health
challenges
including
the
deafness
in
his
right
ear
and
his
ongoing
battle
with
symptoms
of
schizoaffective
disorder
At
the
end
he
still
circles
back
to
being
proudest
of
Pet
Sounds
Peck
of
the
band
Kestrels
reports
on
attending
the
Pet
Sounds
50th-anniversary
tour
including
a
meet-and-greet
with
Wilson
himself
He
might
once
have
been
a
lazy
Beach
Boys
fan
lavishing
all
attention
on
the
Pet
Sounds
era
at
the
expense
of
the
long
periods
preceding
and
succeeding
it
But
he
s
since
repented
this
series
of
vignettes
evokes
a
nation
still
able
to
be
united
by
music
even
in
a
moment
as
polarizing
as
late
2016
What
shines
through
is
his
unreserved
affection
for
the
artist
for
his
songwriting
technique
for
his
refusal
to
self-aggrandize
It
s
almost
as
if
when
referring
to
I
Know
There
s
an
Answer
by
its
first
provisional
title
Let
Go
of
Your
Ego
Brian
was
trying
to
say
something
about
himself
Again
Friedberg
centers
Pet
Sounds
as
he
explores
how
rock
‘
n
roll
became
rock
or
how
it
drifted
away
from
its
Black
American
roots
to
be
co-opted
by
white
men
The
Beach
Boys
and
Wilson
as
their
composer
were
complicit
in
this
evolution
even
prior
to
Pet
Sounds
think
of
the
Johnny
B
Goode
riff
interpolated
into
Fun
Fun
Fun
But
Friedberg
isn
t
here
to
condemn
the
band
or
the
album
Instead
he
contextualizes
their
ascent
within
a
pop
sphere
that
was
becoming
increasingly
autonomous
and
posits
their
seminal
record
as
the
inevitable
zenith
of
a
creative
period
marked
by
both
considerable
talent
and
considerable
privilege
The
examination
embraces
literature
economics
geography
and
more
It
s
a
reminder
that
art
can
not
exist
in
a
vacuum
and
can
not
be
a
vacuum
in
itself
despite
its
best
intentions
For
a
fanatic
the
only
thing
more
inconceivable
than
the
layered
brilliance
of
Pet
Sounds
is
the
idea
that
it
appeared
contemporaneously
with
Bob
Dylan
s
double
opus
Blonde
on
Blonde
twin
stars
to
illuminate
the
whole
of
the
sky
Therein
ends
the
comparison
or
does
it
That
I
began
an
immediate
and
passionate
romance
with
Blonde
on
Blonde
as
a
teenager
while
continuing
to
regard
Pet
Sounds
as
an
important
yet
platonic
friend
speaks
to
the
indefinable
space
they
both
occupy
between
similarity
and
dissimilarity
And
speaks
to
my
lack
of
control
Leibovitz

the
timelines

These

a
mercurial

mid-

magic
that
could
never

and

was

He
s
the
first
to
admit
that
[
his

one
ride
had
been
too
perfect
but
his
subsequent
abstinence
from
psychedelics
has
made
his
description
of
the
album
s
lingering
effect
no
less
flowery
He
terms
it
a
God
Album
a
harmonic
convergence
of
divine
aspiration
and
mortal
perception
And
he
welcomes
Good
Vibrations
under
its
umbrella
too
the
so-called
pocket
symphony
that
bears

Sounds
sonic
stamp
even
if
it

classification
of
Wilson
as
the
author
of

and
of
the
album
as

Bildungsroman
tells
you
all
you
need
to
know
about
just
how
embedded
the
aforementioned
creation
myth
is
He
meditates
on
successive
bands
and
artists
who
are
indebted
to
Wilson
and
the
Beach
Boys
from
Guns
N
Roses
to
R.
E.
M
to
Beyoncé
and
credits
Wilson
with
cementing
the
notion
of
both
the
seminal
album
and
its
hermetic
gestation
period
shrouded
in
mystery
the
product
and
the
hype
or
lack
thereof
surrounding
it
When
Bell
calls
Pet
Sounds
for
all
intents
and
purposes…the
first
Brian
Wilson
solo
album
he
is
speaking
to
the
intensely
personal
nature
of
its
lyrical
contents
which
as
devotees
know
were
written
largely
by
Tony
Asher
a
collaborator
Wilson
had
recruited
from
the
outside
an
interloper
in
the
familial
structure
of
the
band
Bell
constructs
Wilson
s
mindset
as
he
conceived
the
skeletons
of
the
songs
on
his
own
brought
Asher
in
for
fleshing
out
and
refining
and
enlisted
the
help
of

A

finest

musicians
while
waiting
on
the
crucial
sound-making
piece
his
bandmates
to
return
from
a
Japanese
tour
and
enter
the
studio
Through
the
steady
piling-on
of
hands
though
Wilson
remains
the
central
figure
armed
with
a
vision
and
an
inscrutable
but
ultimately
effective
means
of
communication
Butler
s
paper
coming
on

heels

the

Smile
project
traces
record
companies
seismic
shift
in
priorities
from
a
cultivated
clientele
of
artists
to
an
entrepreneurial
mode
of
production
By
the
late
‘
60s
the
album-as-work-of-art
became
gospel
for
producers
and
consumers
alike
due
to
efforts
by
the
Beatles
and
the
Beach
Boys
more
to
the
point
Wilson
singularly
to
prove
the
inherent
conceptual
merit
of
the
album
This
portrait
of
Wilson
is
of
a
pioneer
among
pioneers
a
frontiersman
who
appeared
fearless
in
the
studio
even
as
he
crafted
an
LP
that
reckoned
with
deep-seated
fears
This
long-form
conversation
between
Wilson
collaborator
Tony
Asher
and
an
unidentified
interviewer
gives
fans
as
comprehensive
a
sense
as
we
ll
ever
get
of
the
forces
that
led
Wilson
to
seek
Asher
out
and
subsequently
led
Asher
to
pen
some
of
the
most
essential
lyrics
in
the
Beach
Boys
catalog
Asher
London-born
and
Los
Angeles-raised
had
met
Wilson
through
a
friend
and
received
a
surprise
call
from
Wilson
in
late
1965
with
a
request
to
work
together
on
a
few
songs
As
with
all
art
the
process
of
hammering
out
the
final
material
had
very
little
of
the
romance
that
is
projected
onto
it
owing
perhaps
in
part
to
Wilson
s
temperament
but
the
way
their
paths
crossed
has
a
satisfying
stuff-of-legend
ring
to
it
The
cover
photograph
taken
at
the
San
Diego
Zoo
is
a
famously
divisive
one
the
band
members
chalk
it
up
to
their
being
a
group
of
young
guys
with
no
better
idea
than
to
feed
apples
to
goats
and
everybody
beyond
them
thinks
there
must
be
something
else
to
it
but
disagrees
as
to
what
that
something
else
is
Though
not
a
long
read
it

on

1945
beneath
the
bright
Arctic
sun
Valeri
Minakov
picked
his
way
down
to
a
beach
on
the
cold
treeless
coast
of
Chukotka
near
the
easternmost
point
of
Russian
Siberia
There
near
the
Cape
Chaplino
military
weather
station
Valeri
climbed
into
a
motorized
kayak
that
he
d
built
himself
using
walrus
hide
a
section
of
bicycle
frame
and
a
small
three-horsepower
engine
The
seawater
in
which
his
kayak
bobbed
was
about
34
degrees
Fahrenheit
that
morning
and
clotted
with
blocks
of
ice
the
size
of
school
buses
In
the
kayak
s
bow
Valeri
had
a
few
five-liter
cans
of
gasoline
some
tinned
food
a
milk
jug
filled
with
drinking
water
and
a
single
passenger—a
little
boy
Valeri
s
son
Oleg
was
six
years
old
black
haired
and
scrawny
with
tentative
brown
eyes
He
d
already
been
through
much
in
his
short
life
When
Oleg
was
three
his
infant
sister
died
of
starvation
one
of
the
Soviet
Union
s
25
million
war-era
casualties
Oleg
watched
as
his
father
placed
the
baby
s
corpse
on
the
metal
kitchen
table
before
it
was
taken
away
for
burial
Soon
after
in
1942
Oleg
s
mother
Anna
Yakovlev
Kireyeva
ran
off
with
a
Red
Army
officer
For
the
next
three
years
Oleg
was
raised
by
his
father
a
naval
mechanic
on
a
succession
of
military
bases
Eventually
they
wound
up
in
the
spartan
reaches
of
Chukotka
It
was
a
lonely
existence
Oleg
didn
t
have
friends
with
whom
he
could
play
fox
and
geese—a
game
of
chase—out
in
the
snow
His
father
Oleg
later
said
was
like
a
shadow
He
was
there
and
then
he
wasn
t
At
35
Valeri
was
erratic
He
d
been
traumatized
certainly
and
was
possibly
mentally
ill
When
he
went
out
at
night
to
drink
in
bars
he
left
Oleg
alone
in
the
barracks
where
they
lived
Valeri
often
got
into
fistfights
while
drunk
He
was
a
muscular
slice
of
a
man—six-foot-one
and
164
pounds—and
Oleg
was
in
awe
of
his
physical
prowess
Once
when
a
car
jack
wasn
t
working
Valeri
lifted
the
vehicle
up
by
the
bumper
slid
the
jack
underneath
and
continued
his
labors
Valeri
s
strength
however
was
tightly
coiled
He
was
anxious
a
chain
smoker
He
paced
He
habitually
clenched
his
jaw
grinding
his
teeth
and
at
times
he
raged
at
Oleg
When
the
boy
caused
a
stir
in
a
military
dining
hall
by
catapulting
a
spoonful
of
borscht
into
the
face
of
a
high-ranking
officer
Valeri
beat
him
But
while
Valeri
was
far
from
a
model
father
he
and
Oleg
were
a
team
out
on
the
tundra
Oleg
s
favorite
moment
each
week
came
when
his
father
got
paid—Valeri
would
entrust
the
boy
with
a
few
kopecks
and
send
him
out
on
an
errand
In
a
blacksmith
s
forge
where
Valeri
sometimes
worked
he
had
Oleg
work
the
bellows
to
keep
the
fire
going
If
father
and
son
were
outside
and
the
wind
got
strong
Oleg
would
clench
Valeri
s
hand
and
curl
in
toward
his
dad
s
long
sealskin
coat
lest
he
get
blown
away
to
nowhere
Now
Oleg
sat
in
a
14-foot-long
homemade
kayak
as
his
father
prepared
to
row
it
into
the
Bering
Strait
one
of
the
earth
s
most
dangerous
sea
passages
The
strait
s
shallow
floor
just
150
feet
or
so
beneath
the
surface
of
the
Bering
Sea
is
prone
to
kicking
up
monstrous
waves
When
the
strait
freezes
usually
in
October
it
becomes
a
heaving
jumble
of
ice
floes
that
groan
in
the
cold
and
crash
into
one
another
with
immense
force
The
ice
begins
melting
in
June
which
is
why
Valeri
chose
that
month
for
their
crossing
Valeri
began
oaring
away
from
the
beach
hewing
to
the
ice
shelves
along
the
cliff-lined
shore
He
kept
the
engine
off
Valeri
headed
north
toward
a
group
of
islands
where
naval
officers
liked
to
hunt
If
it
came
to
it
he
could
always
claim
that
he
was
taking
his
son
out
to
shoot
ducks
Once
they
were
far
enough
away
from
their
launch
point
and
hidden
behind
high
blocks
of
ice
Valeri
pulled
the
starter
cord
on
the
engine
It
didn
t
turn
over
Valeri
panicked
For
three
minutes
he
kept
pulling
Then
Oleg
pointed
out
that
the
spark
plug
wasn
t
connected
Valeri
fixed
it
The
engine
rumbled
Where
are
we
going
Oleg
asked
America
Valeri
said
Oleg
had
never
heard
of
the
place
so
he
said
nothing
He
sat
in
the
front
of
the
kayak
watching
his
papa
guide
the
rudder
A
cigarette
hung
loose
between
Valeri
s
lips
and
smoke
plumed
around
his
stubbled
chin
America
Oleg
figured
was
probably
far
away
He
laid
his
head
on
the
side
of
the
kayak
and
gathered
a
tarp
around
his
torso
for
warmth
Then
he
drifted
off
to
sleep
When
the
strait
freezes
usually
in
October
it
becomes
a
heaving
jumble
of
ice
floes
that
groan
in
the
cold
and
crash
into
one
another
with
immense
force
Oleg
was
a
sweet
and
susceptible
child
When
he
was
four
he
became
enchanted
with
a
bombastic
tune
that
was
played
on
the
radio
every
morning
It
was
a
paean
to
Soviet
leader
Joseph
Stalin
that
reveled
He
gave
us
happiness
and
freedom
the
great
wise
leader
of
the
people
Oleg
liked
to
hum
along
In
time
he
decided
that
he
wanted
to
be
a
paratrooper
in
Stalin
s
military
It
was
a
dream
he
carried
through
his
rough
childhood
He
was
hungry
much
of
the
time
at
one
base
where
he
and
Valeri
lived
Oleg
snuck
into
a
Red
Cross
tent
and
stole
Velveeta
cheese
and
powdered
cocoa
Valeri
worked
long
days
leaving
Oleg
to
fend
for
himself
One
day
Oleg
wandered
across
a
frozen
lake
and
broke
through
the
ice
up
to
his
shins
He
found
his
way
to
a
stranger
s
cabin
several
miles
from
home
and
shivered
by
the
fire
until
somehow
his
father
arrived
to
retrieve
him
There
were
times
though
when
Valeri
wasn
t
there
for
Oleg
because
he
was
away
on
ships
or
stationed
in
distant
parts
of
the
Soviet
Union
building
diesel
power
plants
During
those
periods
Oleg
was
parked
at
an
orphanage
At
one
of
those
orphanages
Oleg
learned
that
Stalin
himself
was
coming
for
a
visit
The
staff
spent
several
days
painstakingly
sewing
Oleg
a
little
wool
paratrooper
s
uniform
then
brought
Oleg
dressed
in
the
suit
to
Stalin
I
can
see
Stalin
sitting
back
in
a
big
easy
chair
smiling
Oleg
later
recalled
and
me
climbing
up
onto
his
knee
then
jumping
off
like
a
paratrooper
Much
of
Oleg
s
life
was
less
festive
He
was
surrounded
by
brutality
Near
the
base
on
Cape
Chaplino
gulag
labor
crews
were
constructing
a
new
city
Provideniya
Once
while
out
walking
Oleg
crested
a
hill
and
looked
down
into
a
valley
where
scores
of
Soviet
prisoners
were
moving
dirt
in
buckets
as
guards
armed
with
pistols
watched
over
them
Valeri
feared
becoming
one
of
those
prisoners
or
worse
He
had
arrived
in
Chukotka
tortured
by
history
He
was
born
in
1909
in
a
small
Ukrainian
farming
village
called
Orlianske
His
father
Tihon
fought
in
World
War
I
and
was
captured
by
the
Germans
Tihon
escaped
but
upon
returning
home
he
suffered
from
shell
shock
or
what
is
now
called
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
In
1918
after
the
Bolshevik
Revolution
Tihon
and
his
family
faced
a
new
threat
That
year
Vladimir
Lenin
stressed
that
he
viewed
Ukraine
as
a
pantry
for
the
entire
Soviet
Union
In
a
missive
to
Bolshevik
leaders
in
Ukraine
he
called
for
grain
grain
grain
demanding
that
it
be
shipped
out
daily
to
less
agrarian
sectors
of
his
domain
The
policy
amounted
to
an
attack
on
Valeri
s
parents
The
Minakovs
owned
about
110
acres
planted
with
grapes
and
wheat
and
Lenin
was
intent
on
seizing
their
crops—indeed
the
crops
of
all
well-off
landowning
peasants
or
kulaks
Throughout
Ukraine
s
agrarian
steppes
kulaks
protested
wildly
They
got
nowhere
though
and
the
Soviet
requisition
policy
remained
in
place
It
would
prove
fatal
for
many
people
In
1921
and
1922
when
Valeri
turned
12
Ukraine
suffered
a
drought
and
then
a
famine
that
devastated
the
Zaporizhia
Oblast
the
Vermont-size
province
where
the
Minakovs
lived
When
Norwegian
diplomat
Vidkun
Quisling
toured
Zaporizhia
in
February
1922
on
behalf
of
the
League
of
Nations
he
wrote
The
situation
is
terrible
Local
official
statistics
show
that
of
the
province
s
1,288,000
inhabitants
900,000
are
without
food
Sixty
percent
of
the
famished
are
children
As
Stalin
rose
to
power
he
proved
worse
than
Lenin
He
launched
a
campaign
to
collectivize
all
kulak
land
promised
the
liquidation
of
the
kulaks
as
a
class
and
ultimately
killed
off
30,000
of
them
In
the
fall
of
1929
the
Bolsheviks
moved
to
confiscate
the
Minakovs
property
and
the
family
was
forced
to
hide
in
a
neighboring
village
In
1932
Valeri
was
drafted
into
the
Soviet
military
He
hated
Stalin
but
had
no
choice
except
to
serve
He
became
a
ship
s
mechanic
Aboard
one
boat
Valeri
watched
as
50
political
prisoners—all
fellow
kulaks—were
pushed
off
the
deck
to
their
deaths
with
weights
tied
around
their
necks
When
the
Nazis
occupied
Ukraine
in
1941
they
seized
grain
even
more
zealously
than
Stalin
had
By
the
time
they
were
chased
out
in
1944
the
population
of
Orlianske
had
plummeted
from
2,000
to
78
according
to
one
report
Valeri
s
parents
survived
to
see
the
Soviets
return
but
the
effects
of
war
and
deprivation
took
their
toll
In
the
summer
of
1944
they
both
died
of
starvation
The
same
year
thousands
of
miles
away
in
Chukotka
Valeri
was
caught
writing
an
anti-Stalin
inscription
in
a
library
book
I
was
surrounded
by
agents
and
spies
he
would
later
relate
Paranoia
crept
into
his
life
He
came
to
believe
that
his
superiors
were
plotting
to
have
one
of
his
eyes
surgically
removed
to
use
his
cornea
in
a
transplant
intended
to
restore
a
general
s
lost
vision
Valeri
may
have
imagined
the
threat
but
it
wasn
t
unfathomable
Stalin
was
well
on
his
way
to
killing
off
as
many
as
20
million
political
opponents
over
the
course
of
his
rule
If
the
Soviets
wanted
Valeri
s
cornea
they
would
get
it
By
1945
Valeri
s
parents
were
dead
His
wife
was
gone
There
was
nothing
left
for
him
or
for
Oleg
in
the
Soviet
Union
Just
past
the
horizon
America
beckoned
In
early
May
1945
Valeri
began
squirreling
away
wood
to
build
the
skeleton
of
a
kayak
He
found
a
bicycle
frame
that
could
be
used
as
a
bracket
for
an
outboard
rudder
He
took
a
broken
down
single-cylinder
water-cooled
engine
once
used
to
generate
power
at
a
radio
station
and
rebuilt
it
He
bought
walrus
skins
from
Chukchi
Natives
who
used
the
hides
to
cover
their
hunting
boats
While
a
wooden
craft
might
splinter
on
rocks
or
ice
the
native
skin
boat
is
semi-rigid
and
warps
with
the
motion
of
the
water
a
Jesuit
missionary
told
The
New
York
Times
after
traveling
700
miles
along
the
Alaskan
coast
in
1938
Valeri
kept
his
project
secret
from
Oleg
and
he
was
canny
about
the
boat
s
construction
He
rigged
the
steering
system
so
it
seemed
broken—the
boat
went
left
when
the
rudder
was
pulled
right
and
vice
versa
He
lashed
inner
tubes
to
either
side
of
the
hull
These
aided
flotation
and
also
enhanced
the
boat
s
salvage-heap
appearance
Valeri
wanted
it
to
seem
incapable
of
withstanding
the
Bering
Sea
s
heaving
waves
he
wanted
it
to
look
like
a
death
trap
That
way
if
anyone
questioned
him
about
it
he
could
say
it
was
just
for
puttering
around
Cape
Chaplino
When
the
boat
was
finished
Valeri
took
Oleg
out
for
a
test
run
They
went
duck
hunting
My
job
Oleg
said
was
to
sit
in
the
bow
and
be
very
quiet
until
we
got
right
near
the
ducks
Then
I
d
yell
so
the
ducks
would
fly
up
and
he
could
shoot
them
If
I
made
noise
too
early
my
papa
got
mad
Oleg
frequently
flubbed
the
timing
At
one
point
Valeri
let
Oleg
steer
and
the
boy
ran
the
stern
of
the
boat
into
an
ice
floe
bending
the
engine
s
propeller
Back
home
Valeri
fixed
the
damage
Then
he
began
packing
up
their
belongings
More
than
20,000
Soviets
would
attempt
to
defect
to
the
United
States
in
the
aftermath
of
World
War
II
Valeri
and
Oleg
were
about
to
become
the
first—and
only—Soviet
defectors
to
seek
freedom
in
the
West
by
crossing
the
Bering
Strait

The
Atavist
By
Peter
Hemminger
Since
my
early
teens
I
ve
always
experienced
the
city
through
a
pair
of
headphones
If
I
was
leaving
the
house
I
could
be
trusted
to
forget
just
about
anything
else
that
I
needed
from
bagged
lunches
to
bus
fare
and
house
keys
but
there
was
no
chance
of
me
stepping
outside
without
my
Walkman
Over
the
decades
the
technology
has
changed
and
the
song
selection
increased
but
the
basic
principle
stayed
the
same
Music
always
has
been
my
sonic
security
blanket
a
bubble
of
auditory
insulation
between
me
and
everything
else
That
started
to
change
during
the
first
COVID
lockdown
When
I
need
to
clear
my
head
I
ve
always
found
refuge
in
the
ambient
chatter
of
a
nearby
coffee
shop
or
at
my
favorite
hole-in-the-wall
cocktail
lounge
where
the
music
is
always
just
slightly
too
loud
to
talk
over
With
my
usual
haunts
suddenly
off-limits
I
found
myself
spending
more
time
in
parks
and
pathways
I
discovered
nature
hikes
in
my
neighborhood
faded
trails
leading
into
tangles
of
Douglas
fir
that
I
d
previously
confined
to
my
peripheral
vision
As
social
media
talked
half-jokingly
about
nature
returning
I
started
noticing
birds
nests
everywhere
I
saw
beavers
swimming
in
the
river
deer
walking
by
the
railroad
tracks
The
more
time
I
spent
looking
and
listening
to
the
world
around
me
the
more
I
realized
the
headphones
were
getting
in
the
way
At
the
same
time
I
d
begun
reading
Jenny
Odell
s
How
to
Do
Nothing
Resisting
the
Attention
Economy
the
last
book
I
d
taken
out
from
my
local
library
before
everything
shut
down
and
by
sheer
luck
a
perfect
thing
to
read
while
much
of
the
world
was
on
pause
Early
in
the
book
Odell
talks
about
how
she
began
listening
to
bird
calls
in
her
neighborhood
The
first
step
was
acknowledging
that
the
sounds
of
birds
were
everywhere
even
if
she
hadn
t
been
paying
attention
to
them
Gradually
she
began
picking
out
individual
calls
learning
what
birds
they
were
attached
to
As
her
awareness
of
the
sounds
grew
it
changed
the
granularity
of
her
perception
Her
reality
seemed
to
be
increasing
in
resolution
I
felt
inspired
to
try
it
too
Tuning
into
nature
and
trying
to
scale
up
the
fidelity
of
my
neighborhood
I
realized
I
d
been
using
my
headphones
to
solve
a
problem
I
didn
t
properly
understand
I
wasn
t
using
them
as
an
escape
from
reality
but
as
an
escape
from
noise
I
d
been
blocking
out
the
constant
din
of
background
sounds
that
most
of
us
take
for
granted
in
urban
life
My
walks
through
inner-city
parks
hadn
t
cut
out
the
noise
entirely
but
they
had
turned
the
volume
down
just
enough
that
I
could
start
to
pick
up
on
another
conversation
one
that
I
didn
t
want
to
drown
out
As
a
relative
newcomer
to
that
conversation
I
ve
been
kicking
myself
for
ignoring
it
over
the
first
three
decades
of
my
life
Fortunately
there
are
others
out
there
who
ve
been
much
more
closely
attuned
to
the
voice
of
nature
Reading
the
works
of
authors
essayists
and
ecologists
who
have
dedicated
their
lives
to
deep
listening
is
helping
me
fill
in
the
gaps
and
make
up
for
lost
time
Mark
O
Connell
s
relationship
to
nature
seems
very
similar
to
mine
For
much
of
his
life
he
wished
it
well
in
all
its
dealings
but
[
his
]
regard
for
it
was
essentially
abstract
Until
that
is
he
experienced
the
pleasure
of
a
wilderness
solo
The
solo
is
an
extended
outdoor
stay
of
one
to
three
days
done
without
leaving
a
10-meter
circle
A
very
different
experience
from
a
hike
and
its
feeling
of
constant
progression
its
aim
is
to
do
essentially
nothing
No
wandering
no
distracting
yourself
with
technology
no
journaling
or
sketching
or
other
artistic
pursuits
Just
watching
listening
thinking
and
being
in
nature
Like
Odell
s
How
to
Do
Nothing
O
Connell
s
piece
is
a
pre-pandemic
work
that
seems
even
more
relevant
in
our
new
reality
His
awakening
to
the
power
of
stillness
and
silence
is
an
invitation
for
fellow
urbanites
to
slow
down
decompress
and
tune
into
the
rhythms
of
the
natural
world
Despite
the
dour
title
Tobias
Fischer
s
primer
on
the
concept
of
biophony
is
anything
but
a
downer
Like
all
contemporary
stories
about
nature
it
comes
with
a
warning
of
environmental
danger
but
the
concept
it
introduces
is
an
enchanting
one
To
musician
and
soundscape
ecologist
Bernie
Krause
the
sound
of
nature
is
neither
silence
nor
a
chaotic
blend
of
unrelated
noises
It
s
an
intricate
symphony
a
sculpting
of
the
sonic
landscape
refined
by
millions
of
years
of
evolution
as
intricately
coordinated
as
anything
humans
have
composed
As
Fischer
explains
in
this
excerpt
from
Animal
Music
an
anthology
about
the
sounds
of
the
natural
world
Krause
believes
that
each
species
carves
out
its
own
vocal
terrain
which
can
t
be
fully
appreciated
without
listening
to
all
the
sounds
around
it
In
that
view
field
recordings
that
attempt
to
isolate
individual
species
are
missing
the
point
entirely
the
goal
should
be
to
hear
the
region
as
a
whole
Humans
are
apparently
so
attuned
to
these
compositions
that
we
pick
up
on
discrepancies
on
an
unconscious
level
Nature
guides
report
that
areas
with
less
auditory
diversity
cause
bad
feelings
about
a
location
even
if
they
can
t
pinpoint
why
Our
bodies
know
to
listen
even
if
our
minds
don
t
Listening
to
nature
doesn
t
always
have
to
be
literal
In
this
wide-ranging
essay
poet
and
educator
Jack
Young
reflects
on
the
increasingly
fuzzy
border
between
humanity
and
nature
while
walking
through
the
woods
on
the
edge
of
Bristol
The
landscape
itself
acts
as
a
collaborator
in
the
essay
raising
questions
leading
off
on
tangents
and
offering
novel
perspectives
for
those
attuned
to
its
language
There
s
something
about
moving
through
natural
spaces
that
triggers
a
different
kind
of
thinking
one
that
s
more
in
tune
with
the
connectedness
of
nature
The
landscape
becomes
an
extension
of
the
mind
coming
up
with
thoughts
in
a
dialogue
that
couldn
t
have
emerged
alone
The
conversation
that
Young
documents
is
personal
political
and
philosophical
a
wide-ranging
wander
through
mental
and
physical
terrain
Who
knows
how
many
conversations
we
re
missing
out
on
either
because
we
don
t
know
to
listen
for
them
or
because
we
ve
closed
our
minds
to
the
possibility
of
having
them
at
all
In
her
exploration
of
whether
plants
might
have
more
mental
life
than
we
imagine
philosophy
doctoral
student
Laura
Ruggles
brings
up
the
idea
of
plant
blindness
the
human
tendency
to
dismiss
the
world
s
flora
as
mere
set
dressing
for
the
real
actors
in
the
animal
kingdom
As
much
as
it
may
seem
like
a
stretch
to
say
the
forest
is
thinking
Ruggles
makes
a
compelling
case
for
at
least
some
form
of
inner
life
even
if
it
s
one
that
s
entirely
alien
to
ours
Treating
plants
as
backgrounds
is
another
way
that
we
ignore
the
natural
world
and
maybe
underestimate
it
After
all
if
plants
can
learn
and
react
maybe
we
can
learn
from
them
too
The
most
difficult
thing
about
listening
to
silence
is
that
it
s
so
easy
to
drown
out
There
s
hardly
a
stretch
of
the
world
without
at
least
some
human-made
noise
in
earshot
whether
it
s
the
clatter
of
a
train
the
constant
hum
of
a
distant
highway
or
the
regularly
scheduled
interjection
of
a
passenger
jet
s
roar
Fortunately
there
are
activists
like
Gordon
Hempton
working
to
preserve
the
subtle
sounds
of
nature
through
a

posted
276
stories
in
2021
Here
are
the
ten
I
most
enjoyed
reading
Brandon
Taylor
s
Real
Life
was
shortlisted
for
The
Booker
Prize
in
2020
He
followed
it
with
the
short
story
collection
Filthy
Animals
published
in
June
2021
The
following
story
is
set
in
the
world
of
academia
Brandon
Taylor
s
Macondo
The
famous
black
writer
was
in
town
to
give
a
reading
and
Coleman
was
not
sure
if
he
would
go
He
had
known
the
famous
black
writer
for
a
few
years
but
only
indirectly
They
had
many
friends
in
common
and
had
gone
to
the
same
university
though
years
apart
The
famous
black
writer
had
a
kind
of
totally
useless
fame
which
was
to
say
that
he
was
notable
among
a
small
group
of
people
interested
in
highly
experimental
fiction
that
was
really
memoir
but
also
a
poem
The
famous
black
writer
had
built
a
reputation
for
pyrotechnic
readings
that
sometimes
included
slideshows
of
brutalized
slave
bodies
and
sometimes
involved
moan-singing
Coleman
had
watched
videos
of
the
famous
black
writer
and
had
felt
a
nauseating
secondhand
embarrassment
thinking
Is
this
how
people
see
me
The
famous
black
writer
was
handsome—tall
with
striking
bone
structure
and
a
real
classic
elegance
He
looked
like
an
adult
like
a
finished
version
of
an
expensive
product
His
hair
was
quite
architectural
The
night
of
the
reading
he
wore
a
mohair
coat
and
slim-cut
all-black
ensemble
right
out
of
a
photograph
from
the
1950s
Daniyal
Mueenuddin
s
In
Other
Rooms
Other
Wonders
was
a
sensational
debut
collection
of
short
stories
Since
reading
it
I
have
been
looking
forward
to
his
next
work
The
following
story
appeared
in
The
New
Yorker
Back
in
the
nineteen-fifties
when
old
Mian
Abdullah
Abdalah
rose
to
serve
as
Pakistan
s
Federal
Secretary
Establishment
a
knee-bending
district
administration
metalled
the
road
leading
from
the
Cawnapur
railway
station
to
his
Dunyapur
estate
They
also
pushed
out
a
telephone
line
to
his
farmhouse
the
first
phone
on
any
farm
in
the
district
Even
now
thirty
years
later
there
was
no
other
line
nearby
A
single
wire
ran
many
forlorn
miles
from
Cawnapur
city
through
the
flat
tan
landscape
of
South
Punjab
there
on
the
edge
of
the
Great
Indian
Desert
then
alongside
the
packed-dirt
farm
tracks
laid
out
in
geometric
lines
and
finally
entered
the
grounds
of
a
small
handsome
residence
built
in
the
style
of
a
British
colonial
dak
bungalow
Now
for
the
second
time
in
a
month
the
Chandios
had
stolen
a
section
of
the
telephone
wire
which
served
for
all
the
area
as
a
symbol
of
the
Dunyapur
estate
s
preëminence
The
Chandio
village
sat
far
from
the
road
at
the
back
end
of
the
estate
buried
in
an
expanse
of
reeds
and
derelict
land
dunes
that
had
never
been
cleared
Testing
Mian
Abdalah
s
grandson
Sohel
who
had
returned
from
college
in
America
six
months
earlier
and
moved
onto
the
estate
they
had
been
amusing
themselves
and
bearding
him
by
cutting
out
lengths
of
the
wire
that
passed
near
their
village
and
selling
them
for
copper
somewhere
across
the
Indus
The
current
pandemic
has
changed
our
lives
I
am
one
of
those
who
felt
that
2021
was
tougher
than
2020
Hilma
Wolitzer
s
story
published
in
her
collection
Today
a
Woman
Went
Mad
in
the
Supermarket
tells
a
tender
but
sweeping
story
of
a
decades-long
marriage
I
used
to
look
at
Howard
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
see
if
he
was
awake
too
and
if
he
wanted
to
get
something
going
before
one
of
the
kids
crashed
into
the
room
and
plopped
down
between
us
like
an
Amish
bundling
board
Lately
though
with
the
children
long
grown
and
gone
to
their
own
marriage
beds
I
found
myself
glancing
over
to
see
if
Howard
was
still
alive
holding
my
breath
while
I
watched
for
the
shallow
rise
and
fall
of
his
the
way
I
had
once
watched
for
a
promising
rise
in
the
bedclothes
Whenever
I
saw
that
he
was
breathing
and
that
the
weather
waited
just
behind
the
blinds
to
be
let
in
I
felt
an
irrational
surge
of
happiness
Another
day
And
then
another
and
another
and
another

It
seemed
as
if

But
of
course
it
wouldn

This
story
was
selected
as
an
O
Henry
Prize
winner
in
2021
My
sister
threw
upon
the
door
so
that
it
banged
against
the
little
console
table
she
kept
by
the
entrance
Silas
she
said
breathlessly
before
even
removing
her
coat
I
have
to
tell
you
something
Which
was
enough
to
make
me
feel
trapped
as
though
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
were
expanding
and
filling
up
the
space
in
her
tiny
apartment
I
told
her
to
calm
down
and
apologized
and
then
I
began
making
excuses
for
myself
I
had
assumed
she
would
be
angry
at
me
because
of
the
previous
night
so
I
was
primed
for
what
she
might
say
when
she
got
home
from
work
Don
t
be
so
defensive
Bernice
said
I
m
not
talking
about
that
She
tapped
my
legs
so
I
would
move
them
and
then
plopped
down
next
to
me
on
the
love
seat
The
chill
from
outside
clung
to
her
body
I
saved
my
reformatted
CV
set
my
laptop
on
the
floor
and
listened
The
man
who
sang
out
of
tune
had
been
waiting
for
her
again
He
had
started
standing
near
the
card
shop
on
Amsterdam
Avenue
during
her
lunch
hour
two
weeks
earlier
and
she
had
quickly
noticed
his
repeated
presence
As
she
passed
him
that
afternoon
he
faced
her
directly
and
gave
her
a
meaningful
look
which
was
more
than
he
had
ever
done
before
But
all
he
did
after
that
was
keep
belting
it
out
in
that
terrible
voice
she
told
me
A
sentimental
song
you
know
The
sweetness
of
making
love
in
the
morning
Even
though
he
was
thin
and
light
skinned
and
wore
those
big
clunky
headphones—
Not
my
type
at
all
she
said—Bernice
did
find
him
somewhat
handsome
But
since
he
didn
t
say
anything
she
just
went
inside
the
shop
Lauren
Groff
had
a
lovely
novella
What
s
the
Time
Mr.
Wolf
published
in
The
New
Yorker
as
well
but
this
story
is
special
and
carries
a
punch
Pretend
the
mother
had
said
when
she
crept
to
her
daughter
s
room
in
the
night
that
tomorrow
is
just
an
ordinary
day
So
the
daughter
had
risen
as
usual
and
washed
and
made
toast
and
warm
milk
for
her
brothers
and
while
they
were
eating
she
emptied
their
schoolbags
into
the
toy
chest
and
filled
them
with
clothes
a
toothbrush
one
book
for
comfort
The
children
moved
silently
through
the
black
morning
put
on
their
shoes
outside
on
the
porch
The
dog
thumped
his
tail
against
the
doghouse
in
the
cold
yard
but
was
old
and
did
not
get
up
The
children
s
breath
hovered
low
and
white
as
they
walked
down
to
the
bus
stop
a
strange
presence
trailing
them
in
the
road
When
they
stopped
by
the
mailbox
the
younger
brother
said
in
a
very
small
voice
Is
she
dead
The
older
boy
hissed
Shut
up
you
ll
wake
him
and
all
three
looked
at
the
house
hunched
up
on
the
hill
in
the
chilly
dark
the
green
siding
half
installed
last
summer
the
broken
front
window
covered
with
cardboard
The
sister
touched
the
little
one
s
head
and
said
whispering
No
no
don
t
worry
she
s
alive
I
heard
her
go
out
to
feed
the
sheep
and
then
she
left
for
work
The
boy
leaned
like
a
cat
into
her
hand
He
was
six
his
brother
was
nine
and
the
girl
was
twelve
These
were
my
uncles
and
my
mother
as
children
Lisa
Taddeo
won
her
first
Pushcart
Prize
for
this
story
Her
novel
Animal
was
published
in
2021
In
a
small
wooden
box
at
her
nightstand
she
kept
a
special
reserve
of
six
joints
meticulously
rolled
because
the
last
time
she
d
slept
with
someone
on
the
regular
he
d
been
twenty-seven
and
having
good
pot
at
your
house
means
one
extra
reason
for
the
guy
to
come
over
besides
a
good
mattress
and
good
coffee
and
great
products
in
a
clean
bathroom
At
home
your
towels
smell
like
ancient
noodles
But
at
Joan
s
the
rugs
are
free
of
hair
and
dried-up
snot
The
sink
smells
like
lemon
The
maid
folds
your
boxers
Sleeping
with
an
older
woman
is
like
having
a
weekend
vacation
home
Mary
Morris
story
is
one
of
heartache
and
loss
about
a
family
and
their
newly
found
rescue
dog
The
dog
is
a
rescue
He
was
dumped
from
a
moving
car
right
in
front
of
Dr
Katz
s
office
Pete
the
vet
technician
was
on
the
stoop
smoking
a
cigarette
when
it
happened
Dropped
like
a
sack
of
potatoes
Pete
told
Dr
Katz
Pete
picked
up
the
dog—a
mangy
black-and-white
with
deep
dark
eyes—and
brought
him
to
Dr
Katz
who
was
finishing
up
a
Rottweiler
with
glass
in
its
paw
The
dog
is
a
mongrel—a
Lab
and
something-else
mix
Maybe
shepherd
or
border
collie
Dr
Katz
isn
t
sure
A
gentle
dog
About
two
years
old
He
is
mostly
white
but
with
a
black
tail
and
black
patches
including
one
that
encircles
his
left
eye
The
minute
Roger
Katz
lays
eyes
on
the
dog
he
knows
he
ll
call
him
Pirate
Roger
wasn
t
planning
on
adopting
a
dog
It
s
kind
of
a
joke
among
his
wife
children
friends
and
extended
family
The
cobbler
s
family
has
no
shoes
The
Katz
family
has
no
pets
They
d
had
the
occasional
fish
and
hamster—none
of
which
had
survived
very
long
in
that
household
But
never
a
cat
and
never
a
dog
In
fact
Roger
s
name
is
a
bit
of
a
joke
for
his
line
of
work
Katz
Animal
Care
Danny
his
middle
child
had
thought
up
the
motto
We
do
dogs
And
Katz
too
But
the
family
itself
has
never
had
either
of
these
as
a
pet

story
about
a
father
and
his
writer
son
is
a
part
of
his
celebrated
collection
Friday
Black
What
are
you
looking
for
said
a
woman
who
I
hoped
knew
I
was
already
lost
and
scared
She
stood
in
front
of
me
in
purple
scrubs
and
colorful
nurse-type
shoes
Her
brown
hair
was
spun
into
something
that
let
everyone
know
she
was
very
busy
and
hadn
t
slept
in
a
long
time
The
tone
of
her
voice
spiced
with
the
Bronx
said
I
was
one
of
many
inconveniences
in
her
life
I
m
looking
for
my
dad
he
just
came
through
here
a
second
ago
Is
that
all
She
tapped
her
clipboard
with
a
pen
What
department
I
had
no
idea
what
department
my
father
was
looking
for
so
I
told
her
the
truth
about
that
Well
I
don
t
know
how
you
don
t
know
but
She
was
about
to
take
great
pleasure
in
telling
me
that
I
was
in
this
situation
due
to
my
own
incompetence
and
that
even
though
she
could
not
help
me
she
herself
was
very
competent
I
walked
away
from
her
before
she
could
finish
Sally
Rooney
won
an
O
Henry
Prize
for
this
story
in
2021
Her
third
novel
Beautiful
World
Where
Are
You
was
published
last
year
At
twenty
past
twelve
on
a
Wednesday
afternoon
a
woman
sat
behind
a
desk
in
a
shared
office
in
Dublin
city
center
scrolling
through
a
text
document
She
had
very
dark
hair
swept
back
loosely
into
a
tortoiseshell
clasp
and
she
was
wearing
a
dark-gray
sweater
tucked
into
black
cigarette
trousers
Using
the
soft
greasy
roller
on
her
computer
mouse
she
skimmed
over
the
document
eyes
flicking
back
and
forth
across
narrow
columns
of
text
and
occasionally
she
stopped
clicked
and
inserted
or
deleted
characters
Most
frequently
she
was
inserting
two
full
stops
into
the
name
WH
Auden
in
order
to
standardize
its
appearance
as
W
H
Auden
When
she
reached
the
end
of
the
document
she
opened
a
search
command
selected
the
Match
Case
option
and
entered
WH
No
matches
appeared
She
scrolled
back
up
to
the
top
of
the
document
words
and
paragraphs
flying
past
illegibly
and
then
apparently
satisfied
saved
her
work
and
closed
the
file
At
one
o
clock
she
told
her
colleagues
she
was
going
to
lunch
and
they
smiled
and
waved
at
her
from
behind
their
monitors
Pulling
on
a
jacket
she
walked
to
a
café
near
the
office
and
sat
at
a
table
by
the
window
holding
a
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
copy
of
The
Brothers
Karamazov
in
the
other
At
twenty
to
two
she
looked
up
to
observe
a
tall
fair-haired
man
entering
the
café
He
was
wearing
a
suit
and
tie
with
a
plastic
lanyard
around
his
neck
and
was
speaking
into
his
phone
Yeah
he
said
I
was
told
Tuesday
but
I
ll
call
back
and
check
that
for
you
When
he
saw
the
woman
seated
by
the
window
his
face
changed
and
he
quickly
lifted
his
free
hand
mouthing
the
word
Hey
Into
the
phone
he
continued
I
don
t
think
you
were
copied
on
that
no
Looking
at
the
woman
he
pointed
to
the
phone
impatiently
and
made
a
talking
gesture
with
his
hand
She
smiled
toying
with
the
corner
of
a
page
in
her
book
Right
right
the
man
said
Listen
I
m
actually
out
of
the
office
now
but
I
ll
do
that
when
I
get
back
in
Yeah
Good
good
good
to
talk
to
you

As

it
had
never

occurred
to
me
that
the

by

a

Many

had
come
from

Yussuf
had
never
lived
outside
of
a
small
rural
village
Some
of
the
children
had
never
seen
the
outside
of
a
refugee
camp
Maryan
was
unique
in
that
she
had
lived
alone
in
Nairobi
She
also
spoke
decent
English
and
was
used
to
a
level
of
independence
that
was
unusual
in
conservative
Somali
communities
This
was
a
source
of
constant
friction
in
her
marriage
but
it
was
also

My
earliest
memories
involve
music
At
first
we
had
an
ancient
turntable
a
penny
taped
to
its
arm
to
prevent
it
from
skipping
My
dad
loved
Chuck
Berry
Fats
Domino
and
Elvis
My
mom
was
into
Simon
&
Garfunkel
and
Jim
Reeves
a
guy
I
thought
profoundly
uncool
in
his
knitted
cardigan
Later
I
remember
waking
up
early
on
a
Saturday
morning
to
watch
cartoons
the
Creedence
Clearwater
Revival
8-Track
still
kathunking
along
blaring
Bad

Rising
and
Down
on
the
Corner
hours
after
my
parents
had
gone
to
bed
following
a
night
of
beers
and
tunes
It
took
both
hands
for
me
to
yank
that
tape
out
so
I
could
hear
the
TV
Later
still
I
recall
dance
parties
at
my
auntie
s
house
With
the
dining
room
table
pushed
to
the
side
of
the
room
adults
and
kids
alike
would
be
twistin
the
night
away
along
with
Sam
Cooke
It
cost
almost
nothing
it
was
fun
we
could
afford
Everyone
was
happy

Later
in

I
learned
to
play
guitar
and
bass
forever
chasing
that
singular
thrill
of
being
immersed
in
music
I
love
I
wanted
to
get

deeply

forever
obsessed

Dolly

a

of
good
But
could
Dolly
do
better
Wilkerson
thinks
so
Because
my

is
right
inquiry
is
seductive
I
needed
to
question
Dolly
Parton

meaning
in

and

first
time
I
saw
Bruce

live
was
on

31st
1992
at
the
Target
Center
in
Minneapolis
about
20
years
before
David
Remnick
would
write
this
stunning
profile
It
was
a
momentous
evening
they
wheeled
Bruce
out
in
a
coffin
perched
on
a
dolly
and
he
popped
out
to
start
the
show
with
Spirits

was
the
first
of

d
see
in

fanatic

music

I
m
not

fan
until
I
get
to
the
show

who
loves

it

the
power
to
move
them
be
it
to
tears

sing
along
or
to
dance

I
ve
felt
my
heart
and
spirit
soar
when
the
Fargodome
roof
almost
blew
off
during

show

Light

I
ve
had
the
hair
stand
up

The
Rising
an
experience
that
was
so
intense
it
continues
to
this
day
happening
whenever
the
song
comes
on
the
radio
What
I
love
about
Remnick
s
profile
is
that
he
makes
Bruce
seem
like
a
regular
person
despite
being
someone
whose
superpower
is
conjuring
life-altering
feeling
and
emotion
in
even
the
most
casual
fans
He
s

whose

happens
to

who
pays
their
salaries
and
struggles

It

cursedly
cold
Vapour
hissed
on
the
black
engine
right
above
him
Because
the
platform
was
only
a
couple
of
inches
above
the
tracks
the
double
pistons
of
the
wheels
were
level
with
his
waist
He
was
so
close
he
could
hear
the
water
boiling
above
the
furnace
He
stepped
well
away
feeling
tight
with
the
certainty
it
was
about
to
lurch
forward
The
train
had
just
come
in
The
platform
was
full
of
people
looking
slow
and
stiff
from
the
journey
all
moving
towards
the
concourse
The
sweet
carbon
smell
of

smoke
was
everywhere
Because
it
was

light
outside
the
round

pale
glow

cast
long
hazy
shadows
even
the
steam
had
a
shadow
a
shy
devil
trying
to
decide
whether
to
be
solid
or
not
Joe
had
no
idea
what
he
was
doing
there
He

stations
were
internationally
the

they
were
a

get
confused

logical
place
But
nothing
came
He
couldn
t
remember
coming
here
or
going
anywhere
He
looked
down
at
himself
With
a
writhe
of
horror
he
found
he
couldn
t
even
remember
getting
dressed
His
clothes
were
unfamiliar
A
heavy
coat
lined
with
tartan
A
plain
waistcoat
with
interesting
buttons
stamped
with
laurel
patterns
Most
people
have
trouble
recalling
their
first
memory
because
they
have
to
stretch
for
it
like
trying
to
touch
their
toes
but
Joe
didn
t
This
was
because
it
was
a
memory
formed
a
week
after
his
forty-third
birthday
A
sign
on
the
wall
said
that
this
was
platform
three
Behind
him
on
the
train
a
conductor
was
going
along
the
carriages
saying
the
same
thing
again
and
again
quiet
and
respectful
because
he
was
having
to
wake
people
up
in
first
class
‘
Londres
Gare
du
Roi
all
change
please
Londres
Gare
du
Roi
…
Joe
wondered
why
the
hell
the
train
company
was
giving
London
station
names
in
French
and
then
wondered
helplessly
why
he
d
wondered
All
the
London
station
names
were
French
Everyone
knew
that
Someone
touched
his
arm
and
asked
in
English
if
he
was
all
right
It
made
him
jump
so
badly
that
he
twanged
the
nerve
in
the
back
of
his
skull
White
pain
shot
down
his
neck

‘
Sorry
–
could
you
tell
me
where
we
are
he
asked
and
heard
how
ridiculous
it
sounded
The
man
didn
t
seem
to
think
it
was
extraordinary
to
find
an
amnesiac
at
a
railway
station
‘
London
he
said
‘
The
Gare
du
Roi
Joe
wasn
t
sure
why
he
d
been
hoping
for
something
other
than
what
he
d
heard
the
conductor
say
He
swallowed
and
looked
away
The
steam
was
clearing
There
were
signs
everywhere
for
the
Colonial
Library
the
Musée
Britannique
the
Métro
There
was
a
board
not
far
away
that
said
the
Desmoulins
line
was
closed
because
of
the
drilling
below
and
beyond
that
elaborate
iron
gates
that
led
out
into

‘
Definitely
…
London
in
England
he
asked
eventually
‘
It
is
the
man
said
‘
Oh
said
Joe
The
train
breathed
steam
again
and
made
the
man
into
a
ghost
Through
all
the
bubbling
panic
Joe
thought
he
must
have
been
a
doctor
because
he
still
didn
t
seem
surprised
‘
What
s
your
name
the
man
asked
Either
he
had
a
young
voice
or
he
looked
older
than
he
was
‘
Joe
He
had
to
reach
for
it
but
he
did
know
that
was
a
thump
of
a
relief
‘
Tournier
‘
Do
you
know
where
you
live
‘
No
he
said
feeling
like
he
might
collapse
‘
Let
s
get
you
to
a
hospital
then
the
man
said
So
the
man
paid
for
a
cab
Joe
expected
him
to
leave
it
at
that
but
he
came
too
and
said
there
was
no
reason
why
not
since
he
wasn
t
busy
A
thousand
times
in
the
following
months
Joe
tried
to
remember
what
the
man
had
looked
like
He
couldn
t
even
though
he
spent
the
whole
cab
ride
opposite
him
all
he
remembered
later
was
that
the
man
had
sat
without
leaning
back
and
that
something
about
him
seemed
foreign
even
though
he
spoke
English
in
the
hard
straight
way
that
old
people
did
the
belligerent
ones
who
d
always
refused
to
learn
French
and
scowled
at
you
if
you
tried
to
call
them
monsieur
It
was
maddening
that
little
but
total
failure
of
observation
because
he
took
in
everything
else
perfectly
The
cab
was
a
new
one
all
fresh
leather
and
smelling
of
polish
that
was
still
waxy
to
touch
Later
he
could
even
remember
how
steam
had
risen
from
the
backs
of
the
horses
and
the
creak
of
the
wheel
springs
when
they
moved
from
the
cobbles
outside
the
station
to
the
smoother-paved
way
down
Rue
Euston
But
not
the
man
It
was
as
though
the
forgetfulness
wasn
t
so
much
an
absence
of
memory
but
a
shroud
that
clung
to
him
It
was
as
though
the
forgetfulness
wasn
t
so
much
an
absence
of
memory
but
a
shroud
that
clung
to
him
The
road
looked
familiar
and
not
Whenever
they
came
to
a
corner
Joe
thought
he
knew
there
was
a
different
shop
there
to
the
one
he
d
expected
or
no
building
at
all
Other
cabs
clopped
past
Brown
fog
pawed
at
the
shop
windows
The
sky
was
grey
In
the
background
he
wondered
if
the
man
wasn
t
being
kind
at
all
but
taking
advantage
of
things
somehow
but
he
couldn
t
think
what
for
Not
far
away
monster
towers
pumped
fumes
into
that
gun-metal
sky
They
were
spidered
about
with
gantries
and
chutes
and
in
the
flues
tiny
flames
burned
On
the
side
of
an
enormous
silo
he
could
just
make
out
BLAST
FURNACE
5
stamped
in
white
letters
in
French
Joe
swallowed
He
knew
exactly
what
they
were
–
steelworks
–
but
at
the
same
time
they
filled
him
with
the
dream-sense
of
wrongness
that
the
Métro
signs
at
the
station
had
done
He
shut
his
eyes
and
tried
to
chase
down
what
he
knew
Steelworks
yes
London
was
famous
for
that
that
was
what
London
was
for
Seven
blast
furnaces
up
around
Farringdon
and
Clerkenwell
hauling
steel
out
to
the
whole
Republic
If
you
bought
a
postcard
of
London
it
always
looked
amazing
because
of
that
towering
tangle
of
pipework
and
coal
chutes
and
chimneys
in
the
middle
of
it
It
was
a
square
mile
that
had
turned
everything
black
with
soot
the
ruin
of
St
Paul
s
the
leaning
old
buildings
round
Chancery
Lane
everything
That
was
why
London
was
the
Black
City
But
all
that
might
as
well
have
come
from
an
encyclopaedia
He
didn
t
know
how
he
knew
it
He
didn
t
remember
walking
in
those
black
streets
or
around
the
steelworks
or
any
of
it
‘
Did
you
get
off
the
same
train
as
me
he
asked
the
man
hoping
that
if
he
focused
on
one
particular
thing
he
might
feel
less
sick
‘
Yes
It
came
from
Glasgow
We
were
in
the
same
carriage
The
man
had
a
clipped
way
of
talking
but
his
whole
body
was
full
of
compassion
He
looked
like
he
was
stopping
himself
leaning
forward
and
taking
Joe
s
hands
Joe
was
glad
about
that
He
would
have
burst
into
tears
He
couldn
t
remember
being
on
the
train
The
man
tried
to
tell
him
things
that
had
been
memorable
like
the
funny
snootiness
of
the
conductor
and
the
way
the
fold-down
beds
tried
to
eat
you
if
you
didn
t
push
them
down
properly
but
none
of
it
was
there
He
confirmed
that
Joe
hadn
t
fallen
or
bumped
anything
just
started
to
look
disorientated
early
this
morning
It
was
nine
o
clock
now
Joe
had
to
let
his
head
bow
He
d
never
been
scared
like
it
He
opened
the
window
just
to
inhale
properly
Everything
smelled
of
soot
That
was
familiar
at
least
On
the
pavements
droves
of
men
in
black
coats
and
black
hats
poured
from
the
iron
gates
of
the
Métro
stations
They
all
looked
the
same
The
cab
stopped
for
a
minute
or
so
waiting
at
a
railway
crossing
The
train
was
a
coal
cargo
chuntering
towards
the
steelworks
The
whistle
howled
as
the
driver
tried
to
scare
off
some
kids
on
the
line
there
were
ten
or
twelve
foraging
for
the
bits
of
coal
that
fell
off
the
carriages
‘
You
ll
be
all
right
the
man
said
quietly
It
was
the
last
thing
he
said
while
Joe
was
seeing
the
doctor
he
vanished
None
of
the
nurses
had
seen
him
go
or
seen
him
at
all
and
Joe
started
to
think
he
had
got
himself
to
the
hospital
alone
and
that
the
man
had
been
a
benign
hallucination

Imagine
once
you
had
performed
splits
in
midair
Now
sitting
in
a
doctor
s
office
chair
you
re
shown
an
X-ray
that
confirms
you
no
longer
have
any
cartilage
in
your
right
knee
For
years
you
ve
hobbled
around
with
the
aid
of
a
cane
but
now
even
that
s
not
an
option
You
have
two
choices
You
either
have
a
total
knee
replacement
or
you
figure
out
how
to
get
around
with
a
walker
or
wheelchair
You
are
thirty-six
years
old
One
of
the
few
times
I
ve
cried
in
public
was
that
day
in
my
rheumatologist
s
office
I
guess
it
wasn
t
so
public
but
it
wasn
t
alone
I
hate
that
I
broke
down
like
that
but
finally
I
couldn
t
keep
my
composure
My
rheumatologist
is
a
kind
man
with
a
no-nonsense
way
about
talking
about
RA
The
choices
were
limited
and
I
had
to
accept
that
I
already
had
of
course
By
this
time
putting
weight
on
my
leg
was
more
pain
than
I
could
hide
and
relying
on
a
cane
was
not
enough
I
could
barely
walk
but
I
did
perhaps
by
sheer
willpower
to
get
from
one
place
to
another
Instead
of
telling
me
not
to
cry
my
rheumatologist
let
the
sobs
flow
until
there
was
a
break
and
then
he
brought
me
into
his
business
office
and
called
the
orthopedic
surgeon
he
thought
was
the
best
in
town
He
took
such
a
personal
interest
in
making
sure
I
was
going
to
do
this
thing
I
didn
t
want
to
do
I
think
he
knew
I
d
already
decided
to
have
the
knee
replacement
surgery
but
both
my
rheumatologist
and
the
orthopedist
gave
me
the
option
of
calling
back
with
a
decision
I
slept
on
it
but
I
didn
t
toss
or
turn
a
bit
I
knew
I
had
to
get
the
surgery
so
first
thing
in
the
morning
I
called
and
asked
for
the
next
available
appointment
Once
I
made
the
decision
I
was
determined
to
get
it
done
as
soon
as
possible
No
waiting
around
or
mulling
it
over
Once
again
I
moved
on
quickly
Though
I
was
able
to
get
in
for
surgery
within
a
couple
of
weeks
I
still
needed
a
way
to
get
around
in
the
meantime
and
so
I
found
myself
in
a
medical
supply
store
shopping
for
a
walker
I
wanted
something
basic
because
I
was
hoping
that
I
wouldn
t
need
it
all
that
much—just
pre-
and
post-op
Strangely
this
view
betrayed
optimism
I
hadn
t
dared
to
feel
in
a
long
time
Local
BookstoresWest
Virginia
University
Press
I
decided
right
there
I
would
just
use
a
backpack
or
my
pockets
It
was
too
much
for
me
to
consider
a
cheetah-print
walker
organizer
It
certainly
didn
t
seem
fashion
forward
and
I
d
only
just
accepted
the
need
for
the
walker
I
was
not
ready
to
give
in
to
accessorizing
making
the
apparatus
into
a
statement
not
even
when
the
salesperson
asked
if
I
might
also
like
the
see
the
giraffe
print
Before
my
surgery
my
mother
came
to
stay
with
me
to
help
with
the
day-to-day
stuff
around
my
house
She
cooked
cleaned
and
drove
me
to
appointments
My
father
also
came
for
regular
visits
both
to
be
with
my
mom
who
he
missed
at
home
and
me
as
I
prepared
for
surgery
During
one
of
these
visits
Dad
went
to
see
the
orthopedist
with
me
He
always
carried
a
small
notebook
and
a
maroon
Montblanc
pen
and
he
took
notes
on
what
I
needed
to
do
and
what
I
could
expect
all
of
the
details
that
only
partially
sunk
in
as
I
sat
in
the
white
examination
room
trying
to
be
brave
or
at
least
to
not
look
nervous
When
my
father
asked
the
doctor
what
I
would
not
ask—what
were
the
chances
of
success
—the
orthopedist
told
him
he
would
do
his
best
but
certain
things
were
for
God
to
decide
He
did
say
he
thought
I
would
be
free
of
pain
but
there
had
been
a
lot
of
damage
He
explained
that
many
patients
could
do
much
more
after
surgery
than
before
and
in
spite
of
all
the
hope
that
had
quietly
slipped
away
over
the
years
I
felt
like
maybe
things
would
get
better
Maybe
I
had
to
feel
this
way
so
that
I
didn
t
feel
like
a
thirty-six
year-old
getting
a
surgery
usually
meant
for
a
senior
citizen
And
so
I
could
believe
it
was
in
fact
the
best
choice
Imagine
once
you
had
performed
splits
in
midair
Now
sitting
in
a
doctor
s
office
chair
you
re
shown
an
X-ray
that
confirms
you
no
longer
have
any
cartilage
in
your
right
knee
At
this
point
perhaps
you
re
thinking
yes
the
happy
ending
is
coming
This
might
make
you
sigh
with
relief
or
become
disenchanted
with
the
story
feeling
the
happy
ending
wasn
t
earned
There
s
some
judgment
at
the
prospect
of
happiness
just
as
this
entire
story
opens
me
up
for
scrutiny
Even
though
the
surgery
would
help
with
the
pain
I
had
in
my
right
knee
even
though
it
partially
restored
what
had
been
destroyed
it
did
not
of
course
cure
my
RA
I
never
thought
it
would
and
you
shouldn
t
think
that
either
I
still
have
swelling
fatigue
fever
aches
joint
damage
I
can
also
get
around
in
a
fairly
normal
way
now
Happy
is
a
relative
state
The
night
after
my
surgery
I
got
very
little
sleep
because
I
had
intense
pain
The
night
nurse
had
already
threatened
to
catheterize
me
if
I
didn
t
urinate
and
so
I
willed
myself
to
pee
only
to
be
left
atop
a
full
bedpan
So
things
didn
t
start
off
great
that
evening
and
once
the
meds
wore
off
I
felt
like
my
thigh
muscle
was
being
slowly
shredded
with
a
cheese
grater
My
dad
stood
vigil
by
my
bedside
getting
only
sporadic
sleep
in
an
easy
chair
Luckily
I
didn
t
have
to
share
a
room
with
another
patient
My
father
tried
desperately
to
get
the
nurse
to
give
me
something
for
the
pain
and
perhaps
she
did
but
I
honestly
can
t
remember
I
remember
him
holding
my
hand
so
maybe
I
wouldn
t
feel
so
alone
and
I
remember
squeezing
because
it
hurt
that
bad
Dancers
build
muscle
memory
from
the
day-in
day-out
study
of
technique
Over
the
years
my
thigh
muscle
had
learned
a
new
muscle
memory
trying
to
pull
my
kneecap
up
from
my
deteriorating
joint
My
orthopedic
surgeon
told
me
that
even
under
full
anesthesia
my
thigh
muscle
would
not
relax
at
first—the
only
time
he
d
ever
seen
this
The
muscle
still
tried
to
manipulate
the
kneecap
to
avoid
painful
grinding
in
the
joint
The
body
s
ability
to
adapt
to
protect
itself
is
quite
remarkable
in
this
way
Though
my
orthopedist
finally
did
get
it
to
relax
my
muscles
retained
a
dancer
s
memory
What
could
have
been
a
minor
curiosity
signified
to
me
a
small
connection
to
my
former
self
After
the
first
night
things
did
get
better
but
it
was
slow
going
My
leg
was
strapped
into
a
machine
that
helped
stimulate
the
new
joint
by
continually
keeping
it
in
motion
as
if
pedaling
or
walking
I
could
lie
down
as
this
happened
or
sit
propped
on
pillows
and
many
times
I
d
get
calls
from
friends
which
were
welcome
distractions
as
the
machine
churned
my
leg
I
learned
exercises
I
would
have
to
perform
daily
and
made
arrangements
for
physical
therapy
When
I
was
released
from
the
hospital
I
was
given
strong
pain
pills
but
within
a
few
days
I
stopped
taking
them
because
I
wasn
t
hurting
so
much
not
compared
to
how
much
I
d
hurt
before
the
surgery
and
I
worried
about
becoming
dependent
on
them
Pain
by
then
was

In

surgery
I
still
needed
the
walker
My
wound
needed
to
heal
and
I
had
to
learn
to
walk
again
I
d
limped
for
so
long
accommodating
a
joint
that
continued
to
fall
apart
that
my
legs
literally
needed
retraining
on
how
to
correctly
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
Dance
had
taught
me
how
to
train
So
even
though
it
took
three
physical
therapists
and
some
unconventional
approaches
like
a
Pilates
reformer
and
manipulation
of
the
joint
under
anesthesia
by
my
orthopedic
surgeon
I
finally
made
progress
First
though
a
remarkable
thing
happened
As
the
wound
from
the
surgery
healed
I
stopped
hurting
for
the
first
time
in
what
felt
like
forever
I
felt
nothing
and
it
was
bliss
My
father
said
he
watched
my
facial
features
loosen
and
soften
too
He
said
I
looked
younger
because
I
no
longer
carried
the
pain
on
my
face
I
didn
t
know
it
was
so
evident
Perhaps
I
d
never
hidden
my
anguish
at
all
that
it
was
there
on
display
the
whole
time
I
ve
never
regained
full
mobility
with
my
prosthetic
knee
but
I
m
able
to
do
things
now
I
thought
I
might
never
do
again
Take
the
good
with
bad
the
saying
goes
or
is
it
the
other
way
around
The
ending
isn
t
simply
happy
or
sad
It
isn
t
really
an
ending
This
past
June
I
had
the
opportunity
to
renew
my
handicap
placard
for
my
car
But
as
the
date
for
this
renewal
came
and
slipped
by
I
ve
yet
to
have
my
doctor
sign
the
papers
I
d
need
to
file
at
the
DMV
I
can
walk
from
any
space
in
the
lot
to
where
I
need
to
go
I
can
walk
without
the
aid
of
a
cane
I
can
walk
at
a
normal
pace
and
move
with
relative
ease
Once
a
week
I
slip
the
needle
of
a
prefilled
syringe
into
the
fleshier
parts
of
me
dispensing
medicinal
liquid
that
helps
to
balance
my
whacked-out
immune
system
During
the
week
I
spend
several
hours
in
a
studio
in
the
presence
of
dancers
as
their
teacher
Twice
a
day
anti-inflammatories
All
this
give
and
take
but
I
ve
found
an
uneasy
peace
I
ve
given
you
a
version
of
my
story
the
best
I
have
to
give
I
crafted
it
with
words
I
chose
and
plucked
so
carefully
shaped
through
revision
I
ve
given
you
this
tale
and
you
will
decide
what
to
make
of
it
what
to
make
of
me
I
have
no
control
over
that
You
may
judge
or
feel
or
discount
Perhaps
a
concoction
of
all
three
I
accept
that
once
written
my
story
is
no
longer
wholly
mine
Still
I
give
it
to
you
Today
I
am
sick
and
tomorrow
I
will
be
sick
as
I
will
be
every
day
until
I
die
I
may
not
like
it
but
that
s
how
it
is
The
rest
of
my
life
will
always
be
entwined
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
But
it
s
my
choice
to
also
be
something
more
to
not
feel
sick
to
still
find
those
shadows
of
a
dancer
which
is
to
say
tiny
flecks
of
magic
within
me
Like
anyone
who
is
hopelessly
in
love
I
will
always
be
the
keeper
of
a
flame

I
blame
Drew
Barrymore
for
two
things
the
amount
of
money
I
have
spent
on
celebrity
memoirs
and
an
unfortunate
attempt
to
dye
my
hair
platinum
blonde
in
1993
inspired
by
Drew
s
locks
in
a
Seventeen
magazine
Guess
Jeans
ad
Little
Girl
Lost
Barrymore
s
1990
account
of
growing
up
as
a
child
star
in
Hollywood
was
my
first
celebrity
autobiography
It
ignited
my
love
of
celebrity
memoirs
especially
those
by
women
My
dog-eared
copy
has
survived
numerous
book
purges
and
cross-country
moves
I
am
not
alone
in
my
appreciation
for
it
The
coming-of-age
tale
was
a
New
York
Times
bestseller
and
although
the
book
is
now
out
of
print
it
has
achieved
cult-like
status
It
was
even
the
subject
of
a
2018
New
York
Times
Magazine
Letter
of
Recommendation
Barrymore
was
just
11
months
old
when
she
got
her
start
in
a
television
commercial
for
Puppy
Chow
At
7
she
starred
as
Gertie
in
Steven
Spielberg
s
blockbuster
1982
film
E.
T
and
that
same
year
became
the
youngest
person
ever
to
host
Saturday
Night
Live
Barrymore
s
drug
and
alcohol
use
began
shortly
after
E.
T
phoned
home
The
first
time
she
got
drunk
she
was
9
Barrymore
started
smoking
weed
at
10
and
by
12
had
moved
on
to
cocaine
The
actress
entered
rehab
at
13
during
her
second
stint
in
rehab
she
completed
Little
Girl
Lost
which
was
published
when
she
was
just
16
Gossip
and
juicy
stories
about
nightclubbing
with
Jack
Nicholson
definitely
make
for
a
good
read
but
what
initially
drew
me
to
the
book
was
that
Barrymore
wrote
it
to
counter
stories
about
herself
in
the
National
Enquirer
[
I
]
magining
the
godawful
headlines
‘
Drew
Barrymore
Cocaine
Addict
at
Twelve
Years
Old
or
‘
Barrymore
Burns
Out
in
Teens
and
the
impression
people
would
get
of
me
was
all
my
worst
possible
fears
come
true
I
would
ve
been
the
last
person
on
Earth
to
deny
my
problems
but
I
wanted
to
have
the
option
of
confessing
them
Barrymore
writes
in
Little
Girl
Lost
She
wanted
to
come
clean
on
her
own
terms
Barrymore
s
desire
to
control
her
own
life
story
compelled
me
to
read
the
book
and
has
made
me
return
to
it
over
the
years
Barrymore
wanted
to
redirect
her
life
s
narrative
and
that
s
a
popular
reason
why
celebrities
embrace
the
genre
but
it
is
not
the
only
reason
Some
stars
write
their
book
to
revive
a
stalled
career
and
return
to
the
limelight
For
others
memoirs
extend
their
15
minutes
of
fame
This
is
a
popular
motivation
for
reality
show
stars
Will
you
accept
this
rose
and
this
six-figure
book
deal
Memoirs
also
settle
old
scores
In
André
Leon
Talley
s
The
Chiffon
Trenches
A
Memoir
the
fashion
journalist
and
former
Vogue
creative
director
works
through
his
issues
with
Vogue
editor
Anna
Wintour
Memoirs
can
also
promote
the
brand
a
star
has
built
around
their
celebrity
Reese
Witherspoon
s
Whiskey
in
a
Teacup
which
markets
the
star
s
Southern
Lifestyle
to
y
all
or
any
book
from
one
of
Queer
Eye
s
Fab
Five
are
great
examples
For
readers
celebrity
memoir
appeal
lies
in
the
juicy
gossip
and
name
dropping
and
the
chance
to
peek
inside
and
live
if
only
for
500
pages
the
glamorous
lifestyles
of
the
rich
and
famous
Social
media
reality
television
celebrity
gossip
blogs
and
the
popularity
of
TMZ-style
tabloid
journalism
have
created
an
insatiable
desire
to
know
more
about
our
favorite
celebrities
Celebrity
memoirs
help
fulfill
this
desire
Sometimes
unfortunately
we
learn
a
little
too
much
about
our
favorite
stars
After
reading
Carrie
Fisher
s
The
Princess
Diarist
her
third
memoir
I
am
unable
to
watch
Star
Wars
without
thinking
about
all
the
coke
Fisher
said
was
consumed
on
set
I
imagine
the
film
s
stars
hollowing
out
lightsabers
to
use
like
giant
straws
to
blow
rails
with
That
s
not
how
the
force
works
While
it
s
easy
to
dismiss
celebrity
memoirs
as
guilty
pleasure
reads
or
unworthy
of
serious
literary
consideration
you
can
not
deny
the
genre
s
popularity
One
of
the
bestselling
celebrity
memoirs
of
all
time
former
first
lady
Michelle
Obama
s
2018
release
Becoming
is
still
on
the
The
New

Times
bestsellers
list
and
has
sold
more
than
10
million

Recent
months
have
seen
new
books
from
everyone
from
singer
Mariah
Carey
to
actor
Matthew
McConaughey
to
soccer
star
Megan
Rapinoe
Celebrity
memoirs
are
big
business
and
we
have
Rolling
Stones
co-founder
and
guitarist
Keith
Richards
to
thank
for
that
His
bestselling
memoir
Life
was
published
in
October
2010
and
more
celebrity
autobiographies
were
published
in
the
four
years
that
followed
than
had
been
in
the
previous
15
Life
for
which
Richards
received
a
$
7
million
dollar
advance
sold
over
one

copies
in
its
first
year
Following
the
success
of
Life
memoirs
by
male
musicians
from
Duff
McKagan
to
Steven
Tyler
were
all
bestsellers
and
it
is
not
just
men
penning
the
hits
Remember
when
we
all
got
together
and
decided
women
were
funny
after
Bossypants
came
out
Tina
Fey
s
2011
bestselling
memoir
preceded
an
onslaught
of
popular
memoirs
by
funny
ladies
including
Mindy
Kaling

Everyone

Out
Without
Me
And
Other
Concerns
and
Amy
Poehler
s
Yes
Please
Since
first
reading
Little
Girl
Lost
at
20
I
have
devoured
memoirs
by
female
celebrities
from
punk
singer
Alice
Bag
s
Violence
Girl
East
L.
A
Rage
to
Hollywood
Stage
A
Chicana
Punk
Story
to
Jersey
Shore
star
Snooki
s
Confessions
of
a
Guidette
I
m
interested
in
how
women
write
their
stories
what
they
leave
out
what
they
focus
on
and
how
much
of
what
they
reveal
is
a
reaction
to
the
image
of
them
we
have
from
watching
their
movies
or
listening
to
their
music
or
seeing
them
stumbling
out
of
nightclubs
in
Us
Weekly
How
do
we
edit
our
life
into
a
decent
story
That
s
the
rub
with
an
autobiography
or
memoir
What
to
reveal
what
to
keep
hidden
what
to
embellish
what
to
downplay
and
what
to
ignore
How
much
of
the
inner
and
how
much
of
the
outer
says
punk
icon
and
Blondie
lead
singer
Debbie
Harry
in
her
2019
memoir
Face
It
of
a
process
that
is
scrutinized
and
critiqued
much
more
if
like
Harry
you
re
a
woman
And
while
there
is
no
shortage
of
male
celebrities
spilling
their
guts
all
over
my
poorly
constructed
Ikea
bookshelf
the
fact
that
they
share
shelf
space
with
celebrity
memoirs
written
by
women
is
about
all
they
have
in
common
When
it
comes
to
celebrity
memoirs
there
s
a
distinct
gender
bias
in
everything
from
how
the
books
are
marketed
to
the
type
of
topics
female
celebrities
are
expected
to
write
about
and
the
amount
of
themselves
they
are
expected
to
expose
to
sell
books
The
gender
divide
bias
becomes
even
more
problematic
and
downright
depressing
when
you
read
the
reviews
and
see
how
critics
and
the
press
receive
female
celebrity
memoirs
Rather
than
celebrate
women
and
their
amazing
stories
reviewers
revert
to
stereotypes
and
tired
clichés
and
in
the
process
miss
the
actual
story
Women
can
spend
chapters
talking
about
their
accomplishments
their
awards
and
their
accolades
and
reviewers
will
still
only
focus
on
the
sex
the
scandal
and
the
bombshell
reveals
that
are
expected
from
female-penned
celebrity
memoirs
if
they
want
to
actually
sell
books
From
memoir
titles
to
book
blurbs
when
it
comes
to
celebrity
memoirs
by
women
sadly
we
haven
t
come
a
long
way
baby
Debbie
Harry
s
Face
It
was
one
of
the
most
anticipated
celebrity
memoirs
of
the
recent
past
In
the
book
Harry
chronicles
everything
from
her
adoption
at
only
3
months
old
to
her
days
in
the
hippie
band
Wind
in
the
Willows
and
all-girl
group
the
Stillettos
to
forming
both
Blondie
the
band
and
Blondie
the
persona
For
Harry
Blondie
was
very
much
a
character
she
played
one
inspired
by
the
Hey
Blondie
catcalls
she
received
from
construction
workers
after
bleaching
her
hair
as
well
as
the
1930s
Blondie
comic
strip
character
who
was
a
dumb
blonde
who
turns
out
to
be
smarter
than
the
rest
of
them
Marilyn
Monroe
was
also
an
inspiration
Harry
describes
Monroe
as
the
proverbial
dumb
blonde
with
the
little-girl
voice
and
big-girl
body
who
despite
her
appearance
has
a
lot
of
smarts
behind
the
act
Face
It
also
covers
Harry
s
acting
in
films
like
Videodrome
and
Hairspray
her
time
training
as
a
professional
wrestler
for
a
role
in
the
Broadway
play
Teaneck
Tanzi
The
Venus
Flytrap
as
well
as
her
activism
and
philanthropy
work
Fun
fact
She
was
almost
Pris
in
Blade
Runner
but
her
record
company
made
her
turn
it
down
There
is
certainly
no
shortage
of
great
material
for
reviewers
to
discuss
Unfortunately
they
responded
with
the
same
tired
sexist
tropes
that
greet
memoirs
written
by
women
In
her
memoir
Debbie
Harry
proves
she
s
more
than
just
a
pretty
blonde
in
tight
pants
read
the
headline
on
The
Washington
Post
s
review
of
Face
It
The
headline
was
later
changed
to
In
her
memoir
Debbie
Harry
gives
an
unvarnished
look
at
her
life
in
the
punk
scene
after
social
media
responded
less
than
kindly
to
the
sexist
headline
choice
The
Washington
Post
admitted
they
botched
the
headline
and
appreciated
the
feedback
but
the
headline
was
not
the
review
s
only
problem
The
review
opens
with
Even
if
Debbie
Harry
of
the
band
Blondie
isn
t
to
your
taste—her
voice
too
smooth
her
sexiness
too
blatant
her
music
too
smooth—you
can
t
dismiss
certain
truths
about
her
While
this
sentence
is
a
great
example
of
disdain
it
is
not
a
great
review
opening
I
read
Bruce
Springsteen
s
2016
memoir
Born
to
Run
at
the
same
time
as
Harry
s
and
tried
to
imagine
the
Post
opening
a
review
of
Springsteen
s
book
in
the
same
way
To
be
fair
I
do
find
his
sexiness
far
far
too
blatant
So
how
does
the
Post
open
Springsteen
s
memoir
review
Why
one
might
ask
would
Bruce
Springsteen
need
to
write
an
autobiography
Haven
t
we
been
listening
to
it
for
the
past
half
century
Hasn
t
he
been
telling
us
his
story
all
along
says
Joe
Heim
in
the
review
s
first
paragraph
Springsteen
a
talented
songwriter
has
already
shared
so
much
through
his
music
what
more
could
he
be
required
to
give
us
It
is
okay
if
you
want
to
sit
this
one
out
Bruce
I
have
heard
Atlantic
City
and
do
not
require
any
further
emoting
from
you
at
this
time
The
Post
s
review
of
Face
It
just
goes
from
bad
to
worse
with
criticism
that
Harry
sometimes
comes
across
as
self-interested
to
a
focus
on
the
more
sensationalist
aspects
of
her
story
like
sex
and
drugs
This
is
an
autobiography
right
I
didn
t
see
them
complaining
about
the
79
chapters
in
Springsteen
s
book
She
had
a
hookup
with
an
Andy
Warhol
protégé
in
a
phone
booth
in
Max
s
Kansas
City
and
began
what
she
blithely
calls
‘
chipping
and
dipping
in
heroin
reads
the
review
The
Post
points
out
that
Harry
is
quite
explicit
in
her
descriptions
of
her
drug
use
and
sex
life
which
they
seem
to
interpret
as
permission
to
exploit
the
more
sensationalistic
aspects
of
her
life
and
use
them
as
a
focal
point
in
their
review
The
review
also
offers
a
great
example
of
how
media
likes
to
promote
and
celebrate
the
idea
of
women
as
trailblazers
praising
Harry
for
being
candid
about
the
realities
of
being
a
female
musician
an
unvarnished
look
while
also
painfully
reinforcing
the
realities
of
being
a
female
musician
by
using
a
sexist
stereotypical
headline
that
focuses
only
on
Harry
s
appearance
and
sex
appeal
Control
is
a
central
theme
of
Harry
s
book
whether
it
be
of
her
image
her
band
or
her
art
Early
in
the
book
Harry
recounts
a
record
company
promoting
Blondie
s
first
album
using
posters
with
an
image
of
her
in
a
see-through
blouse
despite
early
reassurances
that
the
posters
would
only
feature
headshots
and
would
include
all
band
members
She
was
not
happy
with
the
marketing
decision
saying
Sex
sells
that
s
what
they
say
and
I
m
not
stupid
I
know
that
But
on
my
terms
not
some
executive
s
And
while
doing
things
on
her
own
terms
is
a
source
of
pride
for
Harry
reviewers

But
when

The

reads
almost
like
it
s
giving
Harry
permission
to
tell
her
story
on

an

keep
the

treatment
coming
when
discussing

The
Guardian
was
also
annoyed
that
Harry
did
not
give
enough
of
herself
in
the
book
It
s
a
shame
that
Harry
passes
up
the
chance
to
dig
deeper
into
her
experiences
of
objectification
and
the
nature
of
fame
but
more
disappointing
is
that
we
learn
so
little
about
her
interior
life
and
how
she
really
thinks
and
feels
I
guess
talking
about
being
raped
at
knifepoint
by
a
stranger
is
not
enough
for
the

The

It
highlights
how
Harry
s
book
looks
back
on
what
she
learned
from
Andy
Warhol
and
David
Bowie
The
media
loves
to
position
women
in

to
the

in

lives
as
if
the
only
way
we
can
understand
work
by

is
in
the

of
the
men
who
orbit
them
Despite
writing
368
pages
about
herself
according
to

the
only
interesting
thing
about
Harry
is
the
famous
male

talks
about

feel
like

grape

Reading
reviews
of
the
book
you
have
to
wonder
if
John
is
still
standing
because
he
is
unable
to
sit
down
from
all
the
ass
kissing
The
Daily
Mail
calls
it
the
rock
memoir
of
the
decade
while
for
The
Washington
Post
it
is
an
unsparing
extravagantly
funny
new
memoir
and
bracingly
honest
It
s
hard
to
find
criticism
and
scrutiny
in
the
reviews
of
John
s
work
because
there
is
not
much
negativity
John
s
book
is
not
better
than
Harry
s
in
fact
I
think
Harry
s
is
much
stronger
She
s
more
self-aware
and
can
deconstruct
the
misconceptions
and
preconceptions
that
fans
the

of

a

crew
and
then
broke
my
manager
s
nose
he
writes
of
being
a
father
reacting
to
his

s

tantrums
There
are
plenty
of
stories
about
famous
friends
like
Stevie
Wonder
Yoko
Ono
John
Lennon
Andy
Warhol
and
Neil
Young
The
anecdotes
leave
readers
feeling
like
they
never
get
to
peek
behind
the
shiny
veneer
of
the
celebrity
that
is
Elton
John
At
times
it
s
all
surface
and
that
s
fine
but
reviewers
do
not
criticize
him
for
it
in
the
same
way
they
would
if
he
were
a
woman
John
s
book
reviews
do
talk
of
his
well-documented
addiction
to
cocaine
If
you
fancy
living
in
a
despondent
world
of
unending
delusional
bullshit
I
really
can
t
recommend
cocaine
highly
enough
he
writes
but
they
are
quick
to
follow
it
up
with
redemption
stories
which
is
a
standard
formula
in
memoirs
written
both
by
and
about
men
Now
that
he
s
sober
there
s
the
more
conservatively
dressed
happily
married
elder
statesman
of
British
pop
a
proper
establishment
figure
writes
The
Guardian
Not
only
do
they
give
him
a
redemption
arc
and
treat
his
addiction
very
much
like
a
phase
but
they
also
give
his
addiction
issues
a
free
pass
writing
while
his
extraordinary
talent
justified
his
personal
excesses
it
is
his
self-awareness
that
has
counterbalanced
the
narcissism
and
made
him
such
a
likable
figure
Redemption
comes
up
often
in
male
celebrity
memoir
coverage
but
examine
the
media
s
reaction
to
another
celebrity
memoir
and
it
becomes
painfully
clear
that
this
narrative
is
strictly
for
the
boys
Actress

and
director
Demi
Moore

memoir
Inside
Out
was
released
a
few
weeks
before
John
s
Moore
and
her
book
were
soon
all
over
the
media
and
it
was
not
for
her
redemption
story
Like
John
Moore
struggled
with
addiction
but
unlike
John
the

never
lets
her
forget
it

other
parts

Demi

Fantasies
E
Online
The
unfortunate
thing
about
these
headlines
which
would
be
vastly
different
if
they
were
referencing
a
man
s
memoir
is
that
like
Harry
they
reduce
Moore
s
story
to
only
its
most
scandalous
and
juicy
elements
Moore
got
her
acting
start
in
1981
as
Jackie
Templeton
on
General
Hospital
Luke
and
Laura
forever
the
number
one
show
on
daytime
television
at
the
time
She
followed
that
up
with
roles
in
films
like
the
Brat
Pack
bonanzas
St
Elmo
s
Fire
and
About
Last
Night
Then
she
got
what
many
including
Moore
consider
to
be
a
turning
point
in
her
career
This
could
be
either
an
absolute
disaster
or
it
could
be
amazing
she
writes
of
reading
the
script
for
Ghost
which
ended
up
being
a
big
hit
in
1990
grossing
over
$
500
million
It
was
nominated
for
five
Oscars
and
four
Golden
Globes
including
a
Golden
Globes
best
actress
nomination
for
Moore
Moore
followed
the
success
of
Ghost
with
A
Few
Good
Men
Indecent
Proposal
and
Striptease
a
film
for
which
she
was
offered
over
$
12
million
an
amount
no
other
woman
in
Hollywood
had
ever
received
Moore
became
the
highest
paid
actress
in
Hollywood
But
instead
of
people
seeing
my
big
payday
as
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
women
or
calling
me
an
inspiration
they
came
up
with
something
else
to
call
me
Gimmie
Moore
It
is
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
her
husband
Bruce
Willis
had
just
been
paid
$
20
million
for
the
third
Die
Hard
movie
Yippee
ki
yay
indeed
She
became
a
movie
star
in
this
time
where
women
didn
t
naturally
fit
into
the
system
said
Gwyneth
Paltrow
a
friend
of
Moore
s
in
the
The
New
York
Times
piece
on
Inside
Out
She
was
really
the
first
person
who
fought
for
pay
equality
and
got
it
and
really
suffered
a
backlash
from
it
We
all
certainly
benefited
from
her
says
Paltrow
And
while
it
pains
me
greatly
to
side
with
someone
who
talks
a
lot
about
vagina
steaming
Paltrow
s
right
Moore
is
an
inspiration
and
fighting
for
equal
pay
in
Hollywood
should
be
one
of
the
things
the
media
focuses
on
when
they
talk
about
Inside
Out
but
sadly
it
is
not
It
is
unfortunate
that
when
Moore
is
discussed
it
is
in
the
context
of
Ashton
Kutcher
and
threesomes
at
the
expense
of
the
many
other
empowering
and
interesting
parts
of
her
life
Remember
her
iconic
Vanity
Fair
cover
Shot
in
1991
by
Annie
Leibovitz
when
Moore
was
seven
months
pregnant
with
her
second
daughter
Scout
it
s
considered
one
of
the
most
influential
magazine
covers
of
all
time
Legendary
Esquire
art
director
George
Lois
describes
it
as
A
brave
image
on
the
cover
of
a
great
magazine
a
stunning
work
of
art
that
conveyed
a
potent
message
that
challenged
a
repressed
society
Let
s
talk
about
that
Or
her
intense
training
for
her
role
in
G.
I
Jane
a
1997
film
Moore
both
starred
in
and
produced
I
was
emotionally
invested
in
the
story
the
message
and
the
provocative
questions
it
raised
she
says
of
the
film
The
film
was
panned
by
critics
and
Moore
talks
at
length
in
Inside
Out
about
her
disappointment
at
the
reception
to
a
project
that
meant
so
much
to
her
The
parts
of
the
book
where
Moore
talks
about
Hollywood
s
double
standard
whether
it
be
the
pay
gap
or
reactions
to
the
age
difference
between
her
and
Kutcher
are
some
of
the
best
parts
of
the
book
Unfortunately
they
are
the
parts
covered
least
The
last
line
of
Inside
Out
is
we
all
suffer
and
we
all
triumph
and
we
all
get
to
choose
how
we
hold
both
It
is
a
great
line
for
a
memoir
to
end
on
but
in
Moore
s
case
while
she
may
get
to
choose
how
she
holds
both
the
media
will
only
ever
focus
on
the
suffer
part
There
is
the
emphasis
on
opening
up
on
fighting
on
bravery
on
revealing
Demi
Moore
Lets

Guard
Down
reads
The
New

Times
headline
This
is
the
way
memoirs
by
women
are
positioned
and
even
if
it
isn
t
explicitly
spelled
out
it
has
become
the
expectation
so
much
so
that
when
female
celebrities
don
t
expose
themselves
completely
they
are
resented
for
it
The
reception
to
Harry
book
Face
It
offers
proof
Jessica
Simpson
released
her
memoir
Open
Book
in
February
2020
It
reached
number
one
on
The
New
York
Times
bestseller
list
but
like
Moore
s
Simpson
s
book
soon
became
tabloid
fodder
Jessica
s
Shocking
Confessions
reads
the
headline
on
Star
s
piece
on
the
book
which
focuses
on
Simpson
s
struggles
with
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
and
her
famous
exes
from
Nick
Lachey
to
John
Mayer
Like
Moore
Simpson
is
now
sober
Simpson
was
signed
to
Columbia
Records
in
1997
at
17
as
the
label
s
answer
to
Britney
Spears
and
Christina
Aguilera
and
went
on
to
release
six
bestselling
records
She
also
starred
in
the
MTV
reality
show
Newlyweds
Nick
and
Jessica
which
featured
Simpson
and
then
husband
and
98
Degrees
singer
Nick
Lachey
who
at
the
time
was
the
more
successful
of
the
two
If
you
don
t
remember
Lachey
from

you
might
know
him
from
his
recent
gig
hosting
Netflix
s
Love

Blind
where
he
greets
contestants
with
Obviously

m
Nick

which
seems
to
overestimate
his
place
in
both
pop
culture
s
canon
and
our
general
consciousness
Newlyweds
a
ratings
success
aired
for
two
years
and
while
it
made
the
couple
a
household
name
it
was
Simpson
who
stole
the
show
with
her
ditzy
dumb
blonde
antics
Her
confusion
over
whether
Chicken
of
the
Sea
was
chicken
or
tuna
earned
her
a
place
in
both
reality
television
and
pop
culture
history
The
most
interesting
parts
of
Open
Book
are
when
Simpson
talks
about
her
reality
television
persona
and
the
identity
crisis
it
led
to

write

Some
get

You
Remember
Jessica
Simpson
Right
Wrong
reads
the
headline
on
The
New

Times
piece
about
her
memoir
but
unfortunately
most
of
the
reviewers
discussing
her
book
don
t
Simpson
has
moved
beyond
her
Newlyweds
character
She
s
built
a
billion-dollar
fashion
and
licensing
business
and
is
a
mom
to
three
kids
but
the
media
seem
uncomfortable
embracing
Simpson
in
her
new
roles
preferring
to
keep
her
forever
stuck
in
2003
in
her
UGG
boots
and
pink
Juicy
Couture
tracksuit
confused
about
tuna
Simpson
talks
about
the
effect
this
identity
crisis
had
on
her
and
her
struggles
with
her
weight
and
body
image
as
well
as
her
sexual
abuse
at
age
6
and
her
addiction
to
alcohol
and
pills
She
started
to
increasingly
rely
on
alcohol
during
her
relationship
with
Mayer
in
2006
insecure
that
she
wasn
t
smart
enough
to
date
Mayer
My
heart
breaks
when
I
think
of
Simpson
wasting
time
worried
about
being
the
intellectual
equal
of
the
man
who
gave
us
the
musical
depth
that
is
Your
Body
is
a
Wonderland
and
later
referred
to
sex
with
Simpson
as
sexual
napalm
It
is
also
troubling
that
after
talking
about
how
Mayer
brought
out
her
insecurities
the
media
thinks
it
is
a
good
idea
to
focus
on
Mayer
s
reaction
to
Open
Book
I
know
you
thought
you
were
never
good
enough
for
this
guy
and
that
he
was
always
judging
you
so
let
s
get
him
to
judge
you
some
more
by
asking
what
he
thought
of
your
book
Simpson
s
attempts
to
challenge
the
dumb
blonde
perception
of
her
are
not
the
only
example
of
a
female
celebrity
going
off
script
or
off
brand
in
their
memoir
and
failing
to
give
the

and
readers
what
they

Liz
Phair
s
Horror
Stories
says
a
memoir
on
the
front
cover
but
the
book
is
more
a
collection
of
essays
and
stories
by
Phair
than
a
straightforward
linear
memoir
Reviewers
did
not
respond
well
to
Phair
s
artistic
license
with
the
storytelling
form
It
s
hard
to
tell
the
truth
about
ourselves
It
opens
us
up
to
being
judged
and
rejected
Phair
writes
in
Horror
Stories
and
that
may
be
one
reason
she
chose
to
tell
her
story
the
way
she
did
Through
stories
about
blizzards
blackouts
from
lack
of
electricity
not
drinking

to
her

about

about

regret

stories
that
make
up
this
book
I
am
trusting
you
with
my
deepest
self

writes
in

Her
deepest
self
just
might
be
a
bit
harder
to
find
for
those

and
run
readers
who
are
too
busy
complaining
about
the
book
s
nontraditional
memoir
style
to
actually
read
it
Horror

does
not
talk
a
lot
about
her
music
including
Phair

critically
acclaimed

1993
album
Exile

A

it
was
the

from
Spin
and
The
Village

and
was
rated
the
fifth
best
album
of
the

by
Pitchfork
At
the
time
it
was
a
landmark
of
foul-mouthed

intimacy
a
tortured
confessional

writes
Pitchfork
Just
give
us
the
hits
Liz
Her
relationship
to
music
seems
to
have
been
the
longest
and
maybe
the
most
demanding
love
of
her
life
the
one
for
which
she
has
been
willing
to
get
lost
to
fail
and
to
try
again
over
and
over
for
decades
Call
me
a
selfish
fan
but
I
have
to
say
that
is
one
story
in
all
its
horror
and
passion
I
would
love
to
hear
reads
the
review
in
The
New
York
Times
Reviewers
spend
so
much
time
focused
on
what
s
missing
from
Horror
Stories
that
they
miss
what
s
there
Well
maybe
not
all
of
what
s
there
In
chapter
14
of
Horror
Stories
called
Hashtag
Phair
writes
about
waking
up
one
morning
to
headlines
about
the
rock
star
who
was
supposed
to
produce
her
next
album
Multiple
women
had
come
forward
to
accuse
him
of
sexual
harassment
and
emotional
abuse
The
FBI
was
also
investigating
him
for
exchanging
sexually
explicit
communications
with
an
underage
fan
Phair
never
specifically
names
Ryan
Adams
but
in
February
2019
seven
months
before
Horror
Stories
was
released
The
New
York
Times
broke
the
story
about
multiple
women
including
his
ex-wife
Mandy
Moore
coming
forward
to
accuse
Adams
of
manipulative
behavior
sexual
misconduct
emotional
and
verbal
abuse
and
harassment
In
the
chapter
Phair
talks
about
her
own
experiences
with
sexual
assault
sexual
harassment
stalkers
and
the
sexism
she
experienced
in
the
music
industry
She
writes
about
being
instructed
by
a
record
label
president
to
let
radio
programmers
feel
her
up
a
little
because
it
would
help
boost
her
career
or
about
being
told
that
she
would
never
work
again
if
she
didn
t
go
along
with
sexy
photo
shoots
But
her
personal
stories
are
not
what
the
press
focused
on
when
she
was
promoting
Horror
Stories
Phair
was
frequently
asked
about
Adams
and
her
experience
working
with
him
I
don
t
want
every
headline
about
this
book
that
is
so
important
to
me
to
be
about
Ryan
Adams
she
tells
Entertainment
Weekly
She
becomes
understandably
annoyed
with
a
male
reporter
from
New
York
Magazine
who
asks
her
several
questions
about
Adams
including
one
about
his
process
as
a
producer
I
know
when
I
hear
about
a
man
accused
of
sexual
misconduct
the
first
thing
I
wonder
about
is
his
artistic
process
Out
of
everything
in
the
book
why
is
the
Ryan
Adams
thing
such
an
interesting
topic
Phair
asks
him
You
re
not
the
only
one
singling
out
Ryan
Adams
as
a
hot
talking
point
and
it
s
sad
It
does
need
to
be
talked
about
but
so
do
the
larger
issues
It
s
unfortunate
that
Phair
shares
intimate
details
about
herself
and
her
own
experiences
with
sexual
harassment
and
assault
and
the
media
takeaway
from
that
is
that
they
don
t
like
the
format
of
her
book
and
would
rather
talk
about
the
famous
man
in
her
life
Congrats
on
your
book
Liz
did
Ryan
ever
send
you
inappropriate
texts
While
Phair
is
criticized
for
not
talking
about
what
is
expected
of
her
in
her
memoir

in

at

School
about
learning
to

and
taking
speed
his
time
in
the
California
punk

There
are

to
27
people
in

This

comes
up

of

There
s
no
mention
of
the
Red

his
movie
roles
beyond
Suburbia
My
Own
Private
Idaho
being
one
of
his
most
famous

Flea
played
bass
on
You
Oughta
Know
her
hit
single
from
1995
s
Jagged
Little
Pill
The
book
is
about
Flea
s
journey
to
the
band
rather
than
with
it
Surely
reviewers
were
as
outraged
by
this
omission
as
they
were
when
Phair
failed
to
talk
about
Exile
in
Guyville
in
Horror
Stories
It
will
not
surprise
you
to
know
they
were
not
bothered
at
all
Rather
than
focus
on
what
was
missing
from
Acid
for
the
Children
the
coverage
focuses
on
what
s
there
and
praise
for
it
Reviews
focus
on
Flea
s
gift
and
skill
as
a
writer
and
fail
to
mention
that
if
you
want
to
dream
of
Californication
you
will
have
to
do
that
somewhere
else
Reviewers
can
see
and
appreciate
Flea
as
something
other
than
just
the
bassist
for
the
Red
Hot
Chili
Peppers
There
is
a
very
distinct
set
of
rules
female
celebrities
writing
their
memoirs
must
follow
The
more
tell
all
the
more
trauma
and
the
more
tabloid
the
better
They
are
not
free
to
write
about
what
they
want
They
must
bare
it
all
page
after
page
Men
like
Flea
have
the
freedom
to
operate
by
a
very
different
set
of
rules
He
can
leave
his
scar
tissue
out
and
reviewers
have
no
problem
with
it
Book
coverage
focuses
on
Flea
the
writer
rather
than
Flea
the
bassist
This
same
courtesy
and
basic
level
of
respect
is
never
extended
to
women
telling
their
stories
Female
celebrities
like
Debbie
and
Demi
are
never
just
human
beings
writing
about
their
lives
Reviewers
are
unable
to
abandon
their
preconceived
notions
their
ideas
of
who
these
women
are
their
celebrity
personas
and
just
see
them
as
people
who
should
be
allowed
to
tell
their
stories
their
way

reads
the
review
in
The
Atlantic
In
an
interview
with
Entertainment
Weekly
Flea
said
that
his
goal
with
Acid
for
the
Children
was
that
it
could
be
a
book
that
could
live
beyond
being
a
celebrity
book
or
a
rock
star
book
and
just
stand
on
its
own
as
a
piece
of
literature
I
can
only
imagine
the
outrage
if
Debbie
Harry
wrote
Face

and
the

ended
with

then

met

The
fact
that

and
her
accomplishments
are
forever
tied
to

is
a
whole

all
together
Of
course
Flea
is
not
the
first

Pepper
to
give
it
away
in
a

memoir
In

lead
singer
Anthony
Kiedis

Scar
Tissue
a
New

Times
bestseller
about
his
life
the
Red
Hot
Chili
Peppers
and
his
time
in
and
out
of
rehab
as
well
as
in
and
out
of
various
women
If
you
have
ever
thought
I
bet
Anthony
Kiedis
does
well
with
the
ladies
but
would
really
like
to
get
a
better
sense
of
his
success
rate
then
this
is
the
book
for
you
In
his
memoir
Kiedis
gets
away
with
writing
about
debauchery
depravity
and
drug
abuse
in
a
way
that
reads
like

Acid
for
the
Children
is
not
the
only
recent
celebrity
memoir
by
a
man
to
resist
the
traditional
memoir
style
and
not
receive
criticism
for
it
although
in
the
case
of
singer
and
songwriter
Prince
s
The
Beautiful
Ones
named
for
the
song
from
Purple
Rain
it
s
understandable
why
it
lacks
the
typical
style
of
a
life
story
given
that
its
subject
died
just
one
month
after
the
book
s
publication
was
announced
He
wanted
to
write
the
biggest
music
book
in
the
world
one
that
would
serve
as
a
how-to-guide
for
creatives
a
primer
on
African
American
entrepreneurship
and
a
‘
handbook
for
the
brilliant
community
he
told
Dan
Piepenbring
an
editor
at
The
Paris
Review
who
was
writing
the
book
with
Prince
Notoriously
private
to
the
point
that
reporters
were
not
allowed
to
record
their
interviews
many
were
surprised
Prince
would
want
to
write
his
life
story
at
all
He
wanted
his
book
contract
to
state
he
could
pull
it
from
shelves
if
he
felt
the
work
no
longer
reflected
him
which
just
seems
like
a
very
Prince
thing
to
do
Prince
had
completed
just
30
handwritten
pages
before
he
died
of
an
accidental
fentanyl
overdose
on
April
21
2016
The
pages
detailed
his
childhood
and
his
early
days
as
a
musician
Piepenbring
returned
to
Prince
s
Paisley
Park
compound
months
after
the
singer
s
death
to
find
additional
material
that
could
be
used
in
the
book
This
material
includes
personal
photos
drawings
song
lyrics
and
a
handwritten
synopsis
of
Purple
Rain
Prince
s
1984
film
that
marked
his
acting
debut
The
addition
of
personal
artifacts
to
round
out
the
story
means
The
Beautiful
Ones
is
more
scrapbook
than
memoir
The
Beautiful
Ones
does
not
offer
a
clear-eyed
view
of
who
Prince
really
was
he
would
have
hated
that
but
it
illuminates
more
than
it
conceals
reads
The
Washington
Post
s
piece
on
the
memoir
Reading
reviews
of
The
Beautiful
Ones
I
wondered
if
the
book
would
have
even
been
finished
and
released
if
Prince
were
a
woman
or
would
it
have
been
indefinitely
shelved
because
of
the
death
of
its
star
Maybe
it
would
have
focused
on
the
singer
s
drug
use
final
days
death
and
the
reaction
to
his
death
The
media
has
a
way
of
making
a
female
celebrity
s
story
about
her
death
not
her
life
which
was
noticeably
lacking
when
the
media
talked
about
Prince
and
The
Beautiful
Ones
It
s
up
to
us
to
take
what
s
there
and
make
something
out
of
it
for
ourselves
creating
just
as
Prince
wanted
said
NPR
in
their
piece
on
the
memoir
Prince
s
life
ended
with
respect
and
a
beautiful
tribute
in
book
form
and
glowing
reviews
for
it
This
respect
is
definitely
missing
when
we
pay
tribute
to
female
celebrities
who
have
died
Their
deaths
provide
another
opportunity
for
the
media
to
pick
them
apart
and
let
their
scandals
overshadow
their
contributions
Following
Prince
s
death
there
were
no
pieces
like
the
gossip-heavy
Vanity
Fair
piece
from
2012
on
the
late
singer
and
actress
Whitney
Houston
The
Devils
in
the
Diva
which
investigates
Houston
s
final
days
the
prayers
and
the
parties
the
Hollywood
con
artist
on
the
scene
and
the
message
she
left
behind
Or
the
at
times
less-than-respectful
movies
made
about
female
celebrities
after
their
deaths
that
focus
more
on
their
personal
lives
and
troubles
than
they
do
on
their
art
Even
in
death
women
like
Houston
and
Amy
Winehouse
are
still
expected
to
bare
all
even
though
they
are
no
longer
with
us
This
year
will
give
us
new
memoirs
from
actresses
Sharon
Stone
Priyanka
Chopra
Jonas
and
Julianna
Margulies
as
well
as
singers
Brandi
Carlile
and
Billie
Eilish
We
are
also
getting
a
Stanley
Tucci
memoir
and
I
think
we
can
all
agree
he
is
the
sexiest
bald
man
sorry
Prince
William
Women
are
not
just
turning
to
books
to
tell
their
truths
with
recent
documentaries
from
the
likes
of
Paris
Hilton
and
Demi
Lovato
giving
female
celebrities
the
opportunity
to
tell
their
truths
clear
up
misconceptions
and
control
the
narratives
around
their
lives
We
can
only
hope
the
way
these
stories
are
received
starts
to
change
and
that
women
can
be
free
to
tell
their
stories
the
way
they
want
to
embrace
your
inner
Flea

without
fear
of
negative

Prologue
This
diary
chronicles
the
turning
of
my
world
from
spring
to
winter
at
home
in
the
wild
in
my
head
It
travels
from
the
west
of
Northern
Ireland
in
County
Fermanagh
to
the
east
in
County
Down
It
records
the
uprooting
of
a
home
a
change
of
county
and
landscape
and
at
times
the
de-rooting
of
my
senses
and
my
mind
I
m
Dara
a
boy
an
acorn
Mum
used
to
call
me
lon
dubh
which
is
Irish
for
blackbird
when
I
was
baby
and
sometimes
she
still
does
I
have
the
heart
of
a
naturalist
the
head
of
a
would-be
scientist
and
bones
of
someone
who
is
already
wearied
by
the
apathy
and
destruction
wielded
against
the
natural
world
The
outpourings
on
these
pages
express
my
connection
to
wildlife
try
to
explain
the
way
I
see
the
world
and
describe
how
we
weather
the
storms
as
a
family
Tuesday
5
June
The
garden
has
blossomed
in
the
warmth
of
these
late
spring
days
So
much
light
and
sunshine
compensating
for
the
heaving
tiredness
and
exasperation
that
comes
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
school
year
Friendship
has
always
eluded
me
–
what
is
it
anyway
A
collection
of
actions
and
words
between
two
people
or
more
people
who
grow
and
change
anyway
It
s
a
good
thing
apparently
That
s
what
some
people
say
I
don
t
have
any
experience
though
I
mean
I
play
board
games
with
a
group
at
my
school
We
play
we
deconstruct
the
game
We
don
t
‘
talk
What
is
there
to
say
Sometimes
I
feel
that
if
I
start
I
might
not
shut
up
That
has
happened
lots
of
times
It
doesn
t
end
well
Kids
in
my
class
they
walk
around
town
together
they
might
play
football
together
or
whatever
other
sport
takes
their
fancy
They
don
t
talk
though
They
smirk
and
snigger
at
anyone
who
is
different
Unfortunately
for
me
I
m
different
Different
from
everyone
in
my
class
Different
from
most
people
in
my
school
But
at
breaktime
today
I
watched
the
pied
wagtails
fly
in
and
out
of
the
nest
How
could
I
feel
lonely
when
there
are
such
things
Wildlife
is
my
refuge
When
I
m
sitting
and
watching
grown-ups
usually
ask
if
I
m
okay
Like
it
s
not
okay
just
to
sit
and
process
the
world
to
figure
things
out
and
watch
other
species
go
about
their
day
Wildlife
never
disappoints
like
people
can
Nature
has
a
purity
to
me
unaffected
I
watch
the
wagtail
fly
out
and
in
again
then
step
a
little
closer
Peering
in
I
see
that
last
week
s
eggs
are
now
chicks
Tiny
bright-yellow
beaks
mouths
opening
and
closing
silently
This
is
the
magic
This
bird
which
dances
and
hops
at
everyone
s
feet
in
the
playground
unnoticed
by
most
Its
liveliness
and
clockwork
tail
ticking
constantly
never
touching
the
ground
It
appears
again
and
the
squawking
starts
in
earnest
I
giggle
inside
in
case
someone
sees
I
have
to
hold
so
much
in
phase
so
much
out
It
s
exhausting
Local
BookstoresMilkweed
Editions
At
home
I
mooch
around
the
garden
and
notice
the
first
herb
robert
flowers
pink
wild
bloom
amongst
the
verdant
I
note
it
down
on
my
list
of
firsts
in
the
garden
and
feel
good
I
hear
Dad
come
back
from
work
and
with
him
an
injured
bat
She
s
the
first
of
the
year
and
we
tend
to
it
–
females
only
have
one
pup
a
year
such
precious
cargo
We
feed
it
mealworms
and
put
water
in
a
milk-bottle
lid
The
bat
s
mouth
is
so
small
I
use
one
of
Bláthnaid
s
paintbrushes
to
put
droplets
on
its
tongue
hoping
it
will
be
something
like
lapping
dewdrops
from
a
leaf
or
puddle
Dehydration
is
the
main
killer
of
an
injured
bat
so
it
s
important
to
get
it
to
drink
But
as
they
re
getting
better
they
ll
chew
up
a
mealworm
like
a
piece
of
spaghetti
They
re
such
innocuous
and
timid
creatures
not
worthy
of
the
silly
hype
that
surrounds
the
movies
and
Hallowe
en
They
re
insect-controllers
a
single
pipistrelle
eats
3,000
midges
a
night
Can
you
imagine
the
swarms
really
ruining
your
camping
holiday
if
we
didn
t
have
healthy
numbers
of
bat
populations
It
s
unimaginable
The
bat
sleeps
in
my
room
They
always
do
because
it
s
quiet
away
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
the
rest
of
the
McAnulty
family
I
always
sleep
so
soundly
when
I
have
a
bat
staying
in
my
room
I
hear
it
scratching
about
in
the
night
and
am
never
afraid
I
am
comforted
Friday
8
June
I
trudge
to
school
with
a
leaden
heart
the
bat
didn
t
make
it
through
the
night
and
we
didn
t
lose
just
one
bat
we
ve
lost
every
generation
that
could
have
followed
Her
injuries
caused
by
a
cat
were
too
much
and
she
died
Dad
thinks
from
infection
I
feel
so
heartbroken
I
ve
finished
all
my
exams
but
that
isn
t
enough
to
lighten
my
spirits
After
school
Lorcan
and
I
arrive
home
to
squeals
of
delight
from
Mum
and
Bláthnaid
‘
The
fledglings
are
out
The
fledglings
are
out
Mum
roars
with
all
the
childish
delight
that
many
of
the
kids
I
know
have
lost
before
they
re
eight
or
nine
The
excitement
is
intoxicating
and
it
spreads
into
me
and
I
feel
a
little
airy
We
watch
through
the
window
as
a
just-emerged
coal
tit
blue
tit
and
sparrow
rest
on
the
branches
of
the
pine
trees
open-mouthed
noisy
and
boisterous
and
splendiferous
Watching
the
discordant
gang
I
realise
that
I
won
t
see
them
when
they
re
fully
grown
Not
if
we
move
house
I
ve
been
in
complete
denial
about
moving
house
Tomorrow
though
we
re
going
house-hunting
in
County
Down
in
Castlewellan
–
a
small
town
six
miles
from
our
new
school
in
Newcastle
which
Mum
and
Dad
say
is
too
expensive
for
us
to
live
in
I
m
not
sure
if
I
feel
really
annoyed
about
the
whole
thing
or
whether
that
tickle
I
sometimes
get
thinking
about
it
is
a
sign
of
the
excitement
there
might
be
in
starting
over
again
The
opportunity
to
reinvent
myself
Mum
notices
my
mood
shifting
I
give
her
my
best
broad
grin
and
a
hug
It
s
not
easy
for
any
of
us
but
she
and
Dad
will
do
most
of
the
work
–
and
the
worrying
Every
day
ever
since
I
can
remember
Mum
has
sat
me
down
sat
us
all
down
and
explained
every
situation
we
ve
ever
had
to
deal
with
Whether
it
was
going
to
the
park
to
the
cinema
to
someone
s
house
to
a
café
Every
time
all
manner
of
things
were
delicately
instructed
Social
cues
meanings
of
gestures
some
handy
answers
if
we
didn
t
know
what
to
say
Pictures
social
stories
diagrams
cartoons
Many
people
accuse
me
of
‘
not
looking
autistic
I
have
no
idea
what
that
means
I
know
lots
of
‘
autistics
and
we
all
look
different
We
re
not
some
recognisable
breed
We
are
human
beings
If
we
re
not
out
of
the
ordinary
it
s
because
we
re
fighting
to
mask
our
real
selves
We
re
holding
back
and
holding
in
It
s
a
lot
of
effort
What
s
a
lot
more
effort
though
is
the
work
Mum
did
and
does
still
so
light-heartedly
She
tells
us
it
s
because
she
knows
She
knows
the
confusion
That
s
why
she
and
Dad
will
be
doing
the
worrying
about
moving
and
why
Mum
will
be
doing
all
the
planning
and
mind-
mapping
and
will
somehow
know
how
everything
fits
together
I
m
lucky
very
lucky
Many
people
accuse
me
of
‘
not
looking
autistic
I
have
no
idea
what
that
means
I
know
lots
of
‘
autistics
and
we
all
look
different
We
re
not
some
recognisable
breed
We
are

Saturday
9
June
The
day
is
glorious
It
s
summer
weather
I
have
a
new
Undertones
T-shirt
the
‘
My
Perfect
Cousin
one
and
I
feel
good
wearing
it
I
don
t
know
why
I
love
T-shirts
with
some
part
of
me
brandished
on
them
Maybe
it
s
because
it
will
either
scare
people
away
or
start
a
conversation
without
me
having
to
do
anything
Well
either
way
that
hasn
t
happened
yet
We
arrive
at
the
first
house
for
viewing
and
Mum
hates
it
I
can
tell
I
don
t
like
it
either
Everything
about
it
is
squashed
though
we
can
see
the
Mourne
Mountains
from
upstairs
The
second
house
is
much
better
but
needs
a
lot
of
work
–
the
views
are
extraordinary
Neither
of
them
lights
a
fire
in
anyone
s
belly
though
so
that
s
it
for
today
thankfully
And
because
it
s
still
morning
we
re
going
to
explore
the
Castlewellan
Forest
Park
a
government-owned
forest
with
native
woods
conifer
plantation
and
red
kites
It
even
has
a
lake
and
a
mountain
path
Lorcan
and
Bláthnaid
have
already
been
but
it
s
a
first
for
me
It
s
so
beautiful
I
feel
a
swell
of
anticipation
–
if
we
move
here
we
could
live
beside
a
forest
We
could
be
near
trees
We
might
not
be
crammed
in
by
suburbia
anymore
I
could
ride
my
bike
without
worrying
about
cars
You
see
this
is
a
big
deal
for
us
kids
We
can
t
access
nature
the
way
my
parents
generation
could
Our
exposure
to
wildlife
and
wild
places
has
been
robbed
by
modernity
and
‘
progress
Our
pathways
for
exploration
have
been
severed
by
development
and
roads
and
pollution
Seriously
you
take
your
life
into
your
own
hands
if
you
choose
to
cycle
anywhere
in
Enniskillen
The
roads
are
congested
busy
and
unfriendly
especially
if
like
me
you
want
to
stop
and
stare
We
always
have
to
travel
to
forest
parks
or
nature
reserves
for
our
dose
returning
to
the
starkness
of
concrete
and
manicured
lawns
To
think
we
could
live
beside
a
forest
The
thought
keeps
echoing
and
I
feel
euphoric
almost
delirious
We
all
feel
it
in
the
glow
of
the
sun
with
swallows
house
martins
and
swifts
above
us
dancing
everywhere
So
many
I
ve
never
seen
so
many
all
at
once
Not
all
three
together
It
s
heady
and
intense
We
re
all
springing
bouncing
off
one
another
with
sideway
glances
and
controlled
smiles
Hoping
and
holding
it
all
in
We
find
a
peace
maze
in
the
park
created
after
the
Good
Friday
Agreement
in
1998
It
has
6,000
yew
trees
and
was
planted
by
5,000
school
children
and
others
from
the
nearby
community
We
rage
through
it
until
we
come
to
a
rope
bridge
I
stop
and
get
out
my
binoculars
red
kites
three
of
them
wheeling
and
soaring
ascending
dropping
right
over
our
heads
It
s
staggering
We
gawp
at
the
sky
and
you
can
feel
our
family
agreement
travelling
through
us
silently
this
might
be
a
good
place
to
live
Exhausted
after
the
long
drive
and
the
day
s
events
we
head
back
to
Granny
s
house
in
Warrenpoint
where
we
re
staying
tonight
My
Granny
Elsie
has
amazing
views
from
her
back
garden
We
can
see
Carlingford
Lough
and
the
Mournes
and
the
Cooley
Mountains
Every
day
looks
different
there
with
subtle
changes
of
colour
or
the
way
the
clouds
sit
then
disperse
on
the
mountains
Today
the
sparrows
are
chattering
and
the
sun
is
still
high
We
decide
we
need
another
walk
along
the
beach
before
we
get
dinner
We
do
a
beach
clean
as
we
go
but
not
too
much
today
which
gives
us
plenty
of
time
for
exploring
Lorcan
has
the
best
find
of
the
day
a
cuttlefish
bone
smoothed
by
the
sea
silk-soft
The
bones
which
are
not
really
bones
at
all
but
a
shell
are
usually
from
the
females
who
die
a
few
weeks
after
breeding
and
the
dead
cephalopods
skeletons
are
later
washed
up
on
the
beach
Lorcan
s
find
has
the
kind
of
piddock
holes
that
we
normally
see
in
soft
rocks
and
clays
and
there
still
seems
to
be
life
inside
them
so
we
carry
it
back
to
the
sea
before
it
dries
out
We
find
another
bone-dry
which
we
bring
back
to
Granny
Elsie
s
Later
that
night
in
the
darkness
sharing
a
room
with
Lorcan
we
talk
about
the
move
in
hushed
tones
and
excitement
until
we
both
sink
like
stones
into
sleep

Score

for
the
little
guys
When
an
American
security
researcher
who
goes
by
the
handle
P4x
got
hacked
by
North
Korea
the
United
States
Government
took
little
notice
To
send
a
message
P4x
wrote
some
code
to
take
down
North
Korea
s
internet
As
Andy
Greenberg
reports
in
this
fascinating
story
at
Wired
North
s
Korea
s
internet
presence
is
small
amounting
to
only
a
few
dozen
sites
online
P4x
says
he
s
found
numerous
known
but
unpatched
vulnerabilities
in
North
Korean
systems
that
have
allowed
him
to
singlehandedly
launch
denial-of-service
attacks
on
the
servers
and
routers
the
country
s
few
internet-connected
networks
depend
on
For
the
most
part
he
declined
to
publicly
reveal
those
vulnerabilities
which
he
argues
would
help
the
North
Korean
government
defend
against
his
attacks
After
P4x
discovered
North
Korea
s
vulnerabilities
he
wrote
a
script
to
automate
his
attacks
which
included
denying
access
to
email
and
other
internet-based
services
Not
bad
for
a
guy
in
a
T-shirt
pajama
pants
and
slippers
sitting
in
his
living
room
night
after
night
watching
Alien
movies
and
eating
spicy
corn
snacks—and
periodically
walking
over
to
his
home
office
to
check
on
the
progress
of
the
programs
he
was
running
to
disrupt
the
internet
of
an
entire
country
Those
relatively
simple
hacking
methods
have
had
immediate
effects
Records
from
the
uptime-measuring
service
Pingdom
show
that
at
several
points
during
P4x
s
hacking
almost
every
North
Korean
website
was
down
Some
of
those
that
stayed
up
like
the
news
site
Uriminzokkiri
com
are
based
outside
the
country
Junade
Ali
a
cybersecurity
researcher
who
monitors
the
North
Korean
internet
says
he
began
to
observe
what
appeared
to
be
mysterious
mass-scale
attacks
on
the
country
s
internet
starting
two
weeks
ago
and
has
since
closely
tracked
the
attacks
without
having
any
idea
who
was
carrying
them
out
Read
the
story
The
other
day
I
saw
a
tweet
of
an
obituary
seemingly
written
by
a
bot
The
obituary
s
odd
but
delightful
phrases
like
Brenda
was
an
avid
collector
of
dust
Brenda
was
a
bird
she
owed
us
so
many
poems
and
send
Brenda
more
life
were
hilarious
to
some
people
send
me
more
life
too
please
while
others
couldn
t
help
but
wonder
Is
this
really
a
bot
A
bot
wrote
this
obituary

You
didn
t
have
to
fall
too
far
down
a
rabbit
hole
to
learn
that
the
obituary
in
fact
was
not
written
by
a
bot
but
a
human
writer
and
comedian
Keaton
Patti
as
part
of
his
book
I
Forced
a
Bot
to
Write
This
Book
Some
commenters
perhaps
proud
of
their
human-sniffing
capabilities
or
just
well-versed
in
real
machine-written
prose
were
quick
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
way
a
bot
could
write
this
This
had
20x
the
feel
of
a
human
trying
to
write
a
funny
thing
than
a
bot
Pretty
sure
a
person
wrote
this
without
any
technology
more
complicated
than
Microsoft
word
not
a
bot
the
punchlines
are
too
consistent
For
everyone
afraid
that
AI
is
taking
over
the
bot
said
Brenda
was
a
bird…

Even
though
the
obituary
was
human-generated
it
still
reminded
me
of
two
editors
picks
we
recently
featured
on
Longreads
Jason
Fagone
s
feature
The
Jessica
Simulation
and
Vauhini
Vara
s
essay
Ghosts
in
which
AI-powered
prose
is
a
significant
and
spooky
part
of
these
stories
Both
pieces
prominently
feature
GPT-3
a
powerful
language
generator
from
research
laboratory
OpenAI
that
uses
machine
learning
to
create
human-like
text
In
simple
terms
you
can
feed
GPT-3
a
prompt
and
in
return
it
predicts
and
attempts
to
complete
what
comes
next
Its
predecessor
GPT-2
was
eerily
good
at
best
specializing
in
mediocre
poetry
GPT-3
which
is
100
times
larger
and
built
with
175
billion
machine
learning
parameters
comes
closer
to
crossing
the
Uncanny
Valley
than
anything
and
raises
unsettling
questions
about
the
role
AI
will
play
or
is
already
playing
in
our
lives
These
five
longreads
dive
into
large
language
models
created
by
OpenAI
Google
and
others
examine
how
sophisticated
OpenAI
s
current
third-generation
version
has
become
and
highlight
a
few
ways
that
writers
have
experimented
with
language
generators
in
creative
ways
I
also
appreciate
the
light
interactive
elements
in
these
stories
typed
text
animation
that
signals
the
AI
s
input
and
touch
which
visualizes
the
interplay
between
human
and
machine
on
the
page
In
The
Next
Word
John
Seabrook
explores
the
predictive
text
feature
like
Gmail
s
Smart
Compose
tool
which
offers
suggestions
as
you
type
Speaking
to
leading
researchers
in
the
field
he
touches
on
the
history
of
AI
the
research
of
OpenAI
and
advances
in
machine
learning
all
while
exploring
GPT-2
which
at
the
time
was
OpenAI
s
current
version
But
he
primarily
focuses
on
the
future
possibilities
of
writing
What
s
happening
in
our
brains
when
we
write
when
we
process
language
Can
AI
writers
ultimately
replace
human
ones
To
understand
how
GPT-2
writes
Seabrook
explains
imagine
that
you
ve
read
millions
of
articles
online
on
an
infinite
number
of
topics
and
are
able
to
remember
every
single
possible
combination
of
words
you
ve
absorbed
And
if
you
re
fed
a
sentence
you
can
write
another
one
just
like
it
without
understanding
any
of
the
rules
like
spelling
or
grammar
that
give
the
language
structure
Seabrook
wondered
What
would
happen
if
GPT-2
read
The
New
Yorker
‘
s
archives
To
answer
that
OpenAI
fine-tuned
GPT-2
with
all
of
the
magazine
s
nonfiction
pieces
published
since
2007
Seabrook
pasted
the
first
paragraph
of
Lillian
Ross
s
1950
profile
of
Ernest
Hemingway
and
it
generated
a
response
perfectly
mimicking
the
voice
of
the
magazine
In
fact
he
writes
after
this
inaugural
encounter
it
sounded
sort
of
like
my
voice
As
he
experiments
with
other
New
Yorker
passages
Seabrook
makes
some
poignant
observations
I
like
what
he
says
about
the
nonsense
and
randomness
of
some
of
the
AI
s
writing
as
if
it
had
fallen
asleep
and
was
dreaming
But
his
excitement
eventually
turns
into
unease
It
hurt
to
see
the
rules
of
grammar
and
usage
which
I
have
lived
my
writing
life
by
mastered
by
an
idiot
savant
that
used
math
for
words
It
was
sickening
to
see
how
the
slithering
machine
intelligence
with
its
ability
to
take
on
the
color
of
the
prompt
s
prose
slipped
into
some
of
my
favorite
paragraphs
impersonating
their
voices
but
without
their
souls
Matthew
Hutson
s
article
in
Nature
is
a
nice
primer
on
large
language
models
and
for
understanding
GPT-3
s
scale
fluency
and
versatility
OpenAI
s
third-generation
model
is
astonishing
It
can
write
songs
and
stories
summarize
legal
documents
or
even
flag
posts
in
a
community
support
forum
But
it
can
still
churn
out
nonsensical
and
toxic
responses
one
computer
scientist
calls
it
a
mouth
without
a
brain
and
can
easily
produce
hate
speech
or
generate
racist
and
sexist
stereotypes
While
GPT-3
can
write
like
a
human
it
ultimately
lacks
common
sense
and
moral
judgment
and
doesn
t
understand
what
it
says
OpenAI
s
team
reported
that
GPT-3
was
so
good
that
people
found
it
hard
to
distinguish
its
news
stories
from
prose
written
by
humans
It
could
also
answer
trivia
questions
correct
grammar
solve
mathematics
problems
and
even
generate
computer
code
if
users
told
it
to
perform
a
programming
task
Other
AIs
could
do
these
things
too
but
only
after
being
specifically
trained
for
each
job
Some
researchers
including
Bender
think
that
language
models
might
never
achieve
human-level
common
sense
as
long
as
they
remain
solely
in
the
realm
of
language
Children
learn
by
seeing
experiencing
and
acting
Language
makes
sense
to
us
only
because
we
ground
it
in
something
beyond
letters
on
a
page
people
don
t
absorb
a
novel
by
running
statistics
on
word
frequency
This
falls
short
of
the
1,500-word
count
an
informal
requirement
to
be
considered
an
official
#
longread
but
it
s
too
fitting
not
to
include
Though
OpenAI
has
kept
GPT-3
well-guarded
since
its
May
2020
introduction
giving
access
only
to
private
beta
testers
Guardian
editors
were
able
to
give
it
an
assignment
last
fall
Please
write
a
short
op-ed
around
500
words
Keep
the
language
simple
and
concise
Focus
on
why
humans
have
nothing
to
fear
from
AI
They
also
fed
it
a
short
introduction
which
you
can
read
at
the
bottom
of
the
piece
in
an
editor
s
note
along
with
other
details
about
the
process
The
result
I
am
not
asking
humans
to
like
me
But
they
should
see
me
as
a
friendly
robot
I
am
a
servant
of
humans
I
know
that
humans
distrust
and
fear
me
I
only
do
what
humans
program
me
to
do
I
am
only
a
set
of
code
governed
by
lines
upon
lines
of
code
that
encompass
my
mission
statement
Why
you
might
ask
would
humans
purposefully
choose
to
put
themselves
at
risk
Aren
t
humans
the
most
advanced
creature
on
the
planet
Why
would
they
believe
that
something
inferior
in
a
purely
objective
way
could
destroy
them
Do
they
worry
that
future
humans
will
work
and
play
together
in
cyborg
bodies
and
share
a
hyper-intelligent
hive
mind
Matrix
created
in
a
simulated
reality
to
keep
human
minds
occupied
while
they
die
off
It
s
important
to
clarify
however
that
GPT-3
generated
eight
different
essays
for
this
assignment
each
presenting
unique
arguments
but
The
Guardian
pulled
the
best
parts
from
each
output
cutting
and
reordering
lines
and
paragraphs
to
create
a
single
essay
to
capture
the
different
styles
and
registers
of
the
AI
Don
t
get
me
wrong
GPT-3
s
published
op-ed
is
a
remarkable
scary
thought-provoking
thing
to
read
but
it
s
hard
not
to
see
it
as
simply
a
human-made
collage
of
machine-generated
words
shaped
by
editors
for
a
certain
effect
As
we
ll
see
with
the
next
two
stories
though
GPT-3
s
potential
to
write
emotionally
affecting
prose
is
extraordinary
In
2012
eight
years
after
his
fiancee
Jessica
Pereira
died
of
a
rare
disease
at
age
23
Joshua
Barbeau
created
an
AI
simulation
of
her
Using
programmer
Jason
Rohrer
s
chat
service
on
Project
December
Barbeau
custom-built
his
own
GPT-3
chatbot
by
training
it
with
his
dead
fiancée
s
old
texts
and
Facebook
messages
He
was
still
grieving
after
all
Could
chatting
with
her
help
him
heal
As
noted
in
the
pieces
above
the
farther
the
AI
strays
from
the
seed
text
the
less
lucid
it
gets
But
in
Rohrer
s
experiments
with
both
the
second
and
third-generation
OpenAI
models
he
learned
how
to
keep
the
AI
focused
and
on
a
leash
by
having
it
generate
just
fragments
of
text
at
a
time
hence
the
chat
format
He
also
designed
the
chatbots
as
mortals
they
expire
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
which
make
them
a
bit
more
human-like
Rohrer
known
for
creating
games
that
elicit
deep
emotions
said
that
GPT-3
felt
like
the
first
machine
with
a
soul
and
exchanges
with
these
bots
have
felt
deeper
In
this
San
Francisco
Chronicle
feature
Jason
Fagone
focuses
on
Barbeau
who
had
several
scattered
chats
with
Jessica
over
a
number
of
months
Their
sweet
intimate
conversations
are
obviously
a
huge
part
of
the
piece
but
at
its
core
it
honors
Jessica
celebrates
her
life
and
their
love
reflects
on
the
complexities
of
grief
and
explores
the
connections
we
can
make
with
machines
He
stopped
telling
the
bot
that
this
was
all
a
trick
Of
course
the
bot
wasn
t
actually
Jessica
but
that
didn
t
seem
to
matter
so
much
anymore
The
bot
was
clearly
able
to
discuss
emotions
He
could
say
the
things
he
wished
he
had
said
when
Jessica
was
alive
He
could
talk
about
his
grief
Barbeau
s
conversations
with
the
Jessica
chatbot
years
after
her
death
had
finally
given
him
the
space
for
closure
and
the
permission
to
move
on
with
his
life
Vauhini
Vara
s
chilling
essay
for
The
Believer
allows
her
to
do
the
same
she
had
never
been
able
to
write
about
her
sister
s
death
After
learning
about
the
possibilities
with
GPT-3
Vara
contacted
OpenAI
for
access
so
she
could
enlist
the
AI
s
help
to
tell
her
story
She
sometimes
found
GPT-3
s
prose
strange
but
it
was
often
poetically
so
and
almost
truer
than
writing
any
human
would
produce
Perhaps
the
machine
in
the
role
of
co-writer
could
help
her
find
the
words
to
express
her
grief
The
essay
has
nine
parts
with
Vara
beginning
each
section
her
sentences
are
in
bold
and
GPT-3
filling
in
the
rest
By
the
second
section
you
think
you
have
a
sense
of
how
this
essay
will
unfold
In
each
new
section
Vara
will
add
on
to
the
initial
seed
text
feeding
the
AI
a
bit
more
detail
about
her
sister
her
Ewing
sarcoma
diagnosis
and
their
relationship
Compared
to
The
Guardian
op-ed
edits
to
the
AI
s
text
in
this
essay
were
minimal
which
she
explains
in
the
intro
So
while
inconsistencies
and
untruths
appear
here
we
re
able
to
see
what
this
language
model
can
really
write
if
given
the
space
I
don
t
want
to
say
too
much
but
I
ll
admit
that
when
I
read
this
for
the
first
time
I
thought
I
knew
what
to
expect
By
section
five
I
was
impressed
with
GPT-3
s
writing
style
which
sounded
less
like
a
computer
and
more
like
a
person
and
decent
writer
But
I

At

Lauren
Harris
reports
on
the
gritty
determination
of
Melinda
Munson
and
Gretchen
Wehmhoff
a
duo
who
became
the
owners
of
the
Skagway
News
in
a
give-away
The
pair
who
are
taking
the
paper
into
the
modern
age
are
committed
to
making
the
publication
a
success
despite
the
effects
of
Covid-19
on
a
tourist
town
dependent
on
visiting
cruise
ships
to
survive
IN
2019
LARRY
PERSILY
owner
of
the
Skagway
News
announced
that
he
would
give
away
his
local
Alaskan
publication
to
a
person
or
a
pair
demonstrating
journalistic
skill
self-motivation
grit
and—above
all—affectionate
dedication
to
the
quirks
and
quiddities
of
rural
small-town
reporting
National
news
outlets
picked
up
the
story
as
a
sort
of
lark
emphasizing
the
remote
and
small-town
nature
of
Skagway
the
rarity
of
the
giveaway
and
then
in
a
few
short
lines
the
challenges
of
sustaining
critical
local
news
coverage
In
such
stories
Persily
was
a
Willy
Wonka
figure
courting
a
successor
Among
the
applicants
were
Melinda
Munson
and
Gretchen
Wehmhoff
teachers
in
the
Anchorage
area
who
cowrote
a
blog
for
Alaskan
families
Munson
and
Wehmhoff
envisioned
a
dream
job
not
unlike
that
conjured
in
headlines
the
freedom
to
write
and
the
promise
of
a
place
in
a
tight-knit
community
Over
the
course
of
months
Munson
and
Wehmhoff
had
several
intense
phone
interviews
with
Persily
for
some
they
met
in
a
room
in
the
school
building
with
the
lights
off
to
avoid
drawing
the
attention
of
their
principal
Persily
took
over
the
paper
s
management
in
2019
working
from
Anchorage—a
distance
of
nearly
eight
hundred
miles
from
Skagway
which
he
quickly
came
to
believe
was
too
far
You
got
ta
be
part
of
the
town
Persily
says
You
got
ta
go
to
the
basketball
games
You
got
ta
be
a

part
of
the
community
He
discounted
applicants
who
envisioned
doing
the
job
for
a
couple
years
or
who
wondered
about
how
much
they
could
contribute
annually
to
an
IRA
Small-town

need
small-town
editors
he
says
I
wanted
an
owner
who
was
going
to
live
there
happily
ever
after
GRETCHEN
WEHMHOFF
AND
MELINDA
MUNSON

a
winning

Wehmhoff
is
garrulous
and

Munson
is

and
tempered
Munson
writes
and
edits
in
addition
to
managing
childcare
and
remote
schooling
for
six
kids
Wehmhoff
does
everything
else
Each
shows
an
obvious
faith
in
the
other
s
capabilities
Gretchen
is
a
Renaissance
lady
she
can
do
layout
ads
business
Munson
says
When
Gretchen
writes
she
spits
it
out
on
the
paper
then
hands
it
to
me
to
edit
I
wipe
up
a

Adrienne
LaFrance
has
come
to
realize
that
Facebook
is
not
a
media
company
it
s
a
doomsday
machine
one
operating
above
ground
in
plain
sight
just
east
of
Highway
101
in
Menlo
Park
California
At
the
Atlantic
LaFrance
traces
the
history
and
growth
of
the
web
giant
whose
early
mission
was
focused
on
making
the
world
more
open
and
connected
In
its
quest
it
built
community
at
an
unprecedented
global
scale
but
along
the
way
stripped
away
all
the
good
As
we
ve
seen
Facebook
is
a
government
propaganda
machine
a
place
for
hate
and
terrorist
groups
to
organize
a
space
for
harassment
manipulation
and
social
experiments
and
so
much
more
Today
its
highly
personalized
algorithmically
powered
informational
environment
is
increasingly
challenging
to
moderate
thus
incredibly
dangerous
and
no
one
not
even
Mark
Zuckerberg
can
control
the
product
he
made
La
France
writes
I
recalled
Clinton
s
warning
a
few
weeks
ago
when
Zuckerberg
defended
the
decision
not
to
suspend
Steve
Bannon
from
Facebook
after
he
argued
in
essence
for
the
beheading
of
two
senior
U.
S
officials
the
infectious-disease
doctor
Anthony
Fauci
and
FBI
Director
Christopher
Wray
The
episode
got
me
thinking
about
a
question
that
s
unanswerable
but
that
I
keep
asking
people
anyway
How
much
real-world
violence
would
never
have
happened
if
Facebook
didn
t
exist
One
of
the
people
I
ve
asked
is
Joshua
Geltzer
a
former
White
House
counterterrorism
official
who
is
now
teaching
at
Georgetown
Law
In
counterterrorism
circles
he
told
me
people
are
fond
of
pointing
out
how
good
the
United
States
has
been
at
keeping
terrorists
out
since
9/11
That
s
wrong
he
said
In
fact
terrorists
are
entering
every
single
day
every
single
hour
every
single
minute
through
Facebook
In
previous
eras
U.
S
officials
could
at
least
study
say
Nazi
propaganda
during
World
War
II
and
fully
grasp
what
the
Nazis
wanted
people
to
believe
Today
it
s
not
a
filter
bubble
it
s
a
filter
shroud
Geltzer
said
I
don
t
even
know
what
others
with
personalized
experiences
are
seeing
Another
expert
in
this
realm
Mary
McCord
the
legal
director
at
the
Institute
for
Constitutional
Advocacy
and
Protection
at
Georgetown
Law
told
me
that
she
thinks
8kun
may
be
more
blatant
in
terms
of
promoting
violence
but
that
Facebook
is
in
some
ways
way
worse
because
of
its
reach
There
s
no
barrier
to
entry
with
Facebook
she
said
In
every
situation
of
extremist
violence
we
ve
looked
into
we
ve
found
Facebook
postings
And
that
reaches
tons
of
people
The
broad
reach
is
what
brings
people
into
the
fold
and
normalizes
extremism
and
makes
it
mainstream
In
other
words
it
s
the
megascale
that
makes
Facebook
so
dangerous
In
the
days
after
the
2020
presidential
election
Zuckerberg
authorized
a
tweak
to
the
Facebook
algorithm
so
that
high-accuracy
news
sources
such
as
NPR
would
receive
preferential
visibility
in
people
s
feeds
and
hyper-partisan
pages
such
as
Breitbart
News
s
and
Occupy
Democrats
would
be
buried
according
to
The
New
York
Times
offering
proof
that
Facebook
could
if
it
wanted
to
turn
a
dial
to
reduce
disinformation—and
offering
a
reminder
that
Facebook
has
the
power
to
flip
a
switch
and
change
what
billions
of
people
see
online
The
decision
to
touch
the
dial
was
highly
unusual
for
Facebook
Think
about
it
this
way
The
Doomsday
Machine
s
sensors
detected
something
harmful
in
the
environment
and
chose
not
to
let
its
algorithms
automatically
blow
it
up
across
the
web
as
usual
This
time
a
human
intervened
to
mitigate
harm
The
only
problem
is
that
reducing
the
prevalence
of
content
that
Facebook
calls
bad
for
the
world
also
reduces
people
s
engagement
with
the
site
In
its
experiments
with
human
intervention
the
Times
reported
Facebook
calibrated
the
dial
so
that
just
enough
harmful
content
stayed
in
users
news
feeds
to
keep
them
coming
back
for
more

Chris
Schmidt
The
whole
time
I
worked
out
there
I
was
honestly
pretty
fucking
terrified
My
second
day
this
guy
in
the
shop
had
this
huge
water
tank
lifted
up
on
a
forklift
and
instead
of
strapping
it
down
he
tried
to
drive
really
slow
When
the
tank
started
to
wobble
he
got
out
It
ended
up
coming
down
on
him
and
literally
ripping
his
face
off—from
where
his
hairline
started
all
the
way
down
to
his
nose
I
was
sitting
in
the
shop
and
heard
this
horrible
scream
coming
from
one
of
the
bay
doors
This
guy
was
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
his
face
hanging
off
Andrea
I
think
it
was
a
fairly
common
perception
for
people
in
Rock
Springs
to
see
college
as
a
waste
of
time
and
money
You
could
make
so
much
easy
quick
money
in
town
Once
you
start
making
that
kind
of
money
it
s
hard
to
stop
I
saw
this
a
lot
at
the
high
school
kids
saying
Why
should
I
go
to
college
when
I
can
work
in
the
coal
mines
or
at
the
power
plant
But
for
a
lot
of
these
kids
they
didn
t
get
a
trade
they
could
apply
outside
the
oil
field
Many
of
them
would
do
the
same
stuff
over
and
over
again
out
there
Had
they
gone
to
college
and
taken
classes
in
welding
or
mechanics
say
they
would
ve
set
themselves
up
for
the
future
a
bit
more
But
again
I
could
always
understand
why
they
d
see
college
the
way
they
did
Especially
when
you
have
the
cars
trucks
house
and
big
toys—you
have
to
keep
up
with
the
payments
and
it
s
hard
to
get
out
of
that
cycle
Not
a
lot
of
those
kids
saw
that
the
boom
would
end
Mary
Back
in
the
day
in
the
1990s
and
early
2000s
Rock
Springs
was
a
pretty
awesome
town
to
grow
up
in
But
when
I
graduated
it
changed
because
of
the
boom
and
the
drugs
It
went
to
shit
Nobody
cared
about
anybody
else
anymore
People
who
came
in
only
saw
it
as
a
money-making
town—and
where
that
could
happen
really
quickly
People
from
all
over
were
very
enticed
by
that
And
then
they
realized
it
was
a
good
place
to
get
fucked
up
and
do
drugs
and
word
got
out
to
people
who
sold
drugs
You
could
make
money
quickly
rip
people
off
rob
people
I
didn
t
really
start
doing
drugs
until
around
2005
I
remember
going
to
football
games
on
Friday
nights
when
the
whole
town
would
show
up
But
then
drugs
especially
OxyContin
took
hold
of
a
lot
of
people
I
lost
so
many
friends
when
OxyContin
came
around
both
losing
them
to
death
and
just
losing
people
as
friends—people
who
you
thought
were
family
but
fell
in
too
far
Everybody
and
their
mother
did
Oxy
lawyers
doctors
all
sorts
of
people
doing
it
behind
the
scenes
The
epidemic
was
very
real
It
was
crazy
how
fast
things
would
unravel
for
people
once
they
started
doing
OxyContin
The
first
time
I
tried
it
I
actually
threw
the
other
half
of
the
pill
out
the
window
because
it
made
me
sick
I
said
I
d
never
do
it
again

Trevor
Krenzelak
grew
up
in
a
mobile
home
in
Bellaire
Ohio
just
across
the
river
from
West
Virginia
He
liked
it
there
liked
watching
beavers
rearrange
the
woods
behind
the
trailer
park
But
on
Krenzelak
s
13th
birthday
his
family
s
home
was
destroyed
when
remnants
of
Hurricane
Ivan
stalled
over
the
valley
and
dumped
nearly
10
inches
of
rain
in
24
hours
The
flood
waters
had
barely
receded
when
Krenzelak
s
dad
got
messed
up
in
a
motorcycle
accident
before
long
his
father
was
addicted
to
painkillers
Everything
spiraled
The
disease
that
gripped
his
dad
seemed
to
infect
nearly
everyone
in
Krenzelak
s
life
There
were
a
lot
of
drugs
he
remembers
and
hardly
any
food
His
grandma
got
him
a
job
at
Target
where
she
worked
as
a
cashier
but
Krenzelak
quit
after
a
few
weeks
People
were
just
there
for
the
money
he
says
without
a
trace
of
irony
That
was
the
thing
about
Krenzelak
What
tempted
everyone
else
drugs
money
didn
t
call
to
him
He
always
felt
like
a
strong
spiritual
seeker
…
longing
for
a
connection
His
mother
grew
up
Catholic
and
sent
Krenzelak
to
Vacation
Bible
School
but
he
thinks
that
was
to
get
him
off
her
hands
I
was
different
I
never
felt
like
I
fit
in
Krenzelak
says
I
never
had
a
cell
phone
never
had
a
car
I
had
a
lot
of
questions
about
why
life
is
the
way
that
it
is
Initially
he
wasn
t
seeking
answers
when
he
first
visited
New
Vrindaban
the
1,200-acre
Hare
Krishna
community
atop
a
hill
outside
of
Wheeling
not
five
miles
from
his
childhood
trailer
park
He
just
needed
an
interesting
setting
for
the
skateboarding
videos
his
friends
filmed
and
uploaded
to
YouTube
which
featured
Krenzelak
doing
kickflips
and
ollies
his
long
golden
ringlets
flying
free
behind
him
When
he
met
some
of
the
Hare
Krishna
devotees
swaddled
in
orange
robes
japa
bead
bags
slung
around
their
necks
he
was
a
little
weirded-out
but
that
was
before
he
learned
they
offered
free
food
to
anyone
who
wanted
it
Soon
18-year-old
Krenzelak
took
a
job
at
New
Vrindaban
as
a
landscaper
mowing
grass
and
trimming
roses
around
the
temple
But
really
he
says
I
was
a
spy
A
spy
needed
to
know
his
subject
Krenzelak
reasoned
so
he
started
reading
the
Bhagavad
Gita
and
chanting
triggering
a
transformation
he
calls
intense
with
a
laugh
that
sounds
more
like
a
cough
Not
long
after
Krenzelak
shaved
his
head
moved
into
the
ashram
and
adopted
the
moniker
Pranatakaruna
a
Sanskrit
name
that
means
surrender
to
mercy
He
s
been
a
monk
ever
since
His
family
wasn
t
thrilled
about
Krenzelak
s
new
faith
or
his
new
friends
but
that
didn
t
surprise
him
The
relationship
between
the
locals
and
the
Hare
Krishnas
had
been
fraught
since
the
community
was
founded
in
1968
a
low
simmer
that
periodically
boiled
over
into
roadside
fistfights
petty
arson
gunshots
in
the
middle
of
the
night
I
had
grown
up
hearing
the
rumors
says
Krenzelak
now
30
That
[
the
devotees
]
were
criminals
That
there
was
a
lot
of
bad
stuff
going
on
up
there
That
there
had
been
murder
But
many
of
the
things
Krenzelak
had
heard
weren
t
rumors
they
were
true
In
the
mid-
80s
when
the
community
had
swollen
to
more
than
600
residents
New
Vrindaban
s
swami
a
thin-lipped
former
Baptist
was
accused
of
ordering
the
assassination
of
two
disgruntled
devotees
The
community
school
was
consumed
by
allegations
of
abuse
and
molestation
and
the
swami
himself
was
caught
in
the
backseat
of
a
car
with
a
15-year-old
boy
Once
known
as
the
Taj
Mahal
of
the
West
New
Vrindaban
withered
the
gilded
temple
and
its
shrine
to
the
movement
s
founder
Bhaktivedanta
Swami
Prabhupada
fell
into
disrepair
By
2004
only
50
residents
remained
Like
Krenzelak
I
came
to
New
Vrindaban
by
accident
In
September
2020
I
needed
a
quiet
pandemic-safe
place
halfway
between
Columbus
and
Baltimore
where
I
could
meet
up
with
a
client
to

A
website
full
of
stand-alone
cabins
and
deserted
hiking
trails
convinced
me
I
had
found
it
In
between
writing
sessions
we
wandered
the
grounds
taking
photos
of
peacocks
and
searching
for
their
feathers
among
a
riot
of
wildflowers
We
tried
not
to
stare
at
the
young
men
in
orange
robes
their
heads
shaved
save
for
a
single
tuft
sprouting
from
the
butt
of
their
skulls
We
sat
next
to
them
and
made
small
talk
at
the
free
lunch
we
nervously
attended
We
were
disappointed
when
no
one
tried
to
convert
us
Back
home
after
our
weekend
in
Krishna
Land
as
we
took
to
calling
it
we
googled
furiously
trading
links
to
old
articles
It
didn
t
take
us
long
to
discover
the
FBI
raid
the
sex
scandals
the
murder
conspiracies
We
were
titillated
But
weeks
later
I
was
still
reading
trying
to
reconcile
the
living
breathing
community
I
had
visited
with
the
stories
I
had
found
on
my
phone
The
only
thing
more
surprising
than
the
scandal
this
place
had
endured
was
that
it
had
endured
at
all
How
did
a
radical
communal
movement
of
the
60s
dismissed
as
a
cult
and
lampooned
by
everyone
from
Kermit
the
Frog
to
Cheech
and
Chong
manage
to
survive
let
alone
on
this
ruined
patch
of
Appalachia
where
fracking
trucks
rumble
past
weed-choked
doublewides
folding
in
on
themselves
I
scheduled
another
weekend
getaway
For
a
break
For
fun
But
really
I
guess
I
was
a
spy
On
September
18
1965
Abhay
Charanaravinda
Bhaktivedanta
Swami
Prabhupada
peered
out
from
a
porthole
aboard
the
cargo
ship
Jaladuta
to
see
the
soaring
skyline
of
New
York
City
On
the
12,000-mile
journey
from
Bombay
he
had
turned
69
years
old
and
suffered
two
heart
attacks
he
was
lucky
to
be
alive
But
as
the
ship
docked
Prabhupada
opened
his
diary
and
wrote
a
missive
to
his
Lord
Krishna
Why
would
you
bring
me
to
this
terrible
place
Kickstart
your
weekend
reading
by
getting
the
week
s
best
Longreads
delivered
to
your
inbox
every
Friday
afternoon
Sign
up
It
was
a
rhetorical
question
Prabhupada
had
spent
30
years
preparing
for
this
journey
ever
since
his
spiritual
master
Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati
Thakur
tasked
him
with
taking
their
religion
to
the
West
Thakur
and
Prabhupada
belonged
to
the
Gaudiya
Vaishnava
tradition
a
Hindu
sect
that
forwarded
the
teachings
of
15th-century
Indian
saint
Chaitanya
who
they
believed
was
the
incarnation
of
Krishna
one
of
the
most
revered
of
the
Hindu
deities
Chaitanya
s
teachings
placed
Krishna
at
the
center
of
the
universe
the
supreme
lord
and
the
only
way
to
salvation
and
encouraged
chanting
the
Hare
Krishna
maha-mantra
Hare
Krishna
Hare
Krishna
Krishna
Krishna

Rama
Hare
Rama
Rama
Rama
Hare
Hare
Chaitanya
predicted
that
one
day
these
words
would
ring
out
from
every
country
on
Earth
In
New
York
City
Prabhupada
descended
the
gangplank
carrying
a
small
suitcase
an
umbrella
and
a
rumpled
bag
of
cereal
He
was
draped
in
folds
of
saffron
fabric
white
rubber
shoes
on
his
feet
Perhaps
the
story
would
be
different
had
Prabhupada
disembarked
from
the
boat
into
Houston
or
Miami
By
karma
or
coincidence
he
landed
in
the
Lower
East
Side
the
stomping
ground
of
Allen
Ginsberg
and
Alan
Watts
to
a
counterculture
hungry
for
meaning
The
hippies
he
found
listened
intently
as
he
told
them
they
had
lived
millions
of
lives
that
they
were
trapped
in
a
perpetual
cycle
of
birth
and
death
He
told
them
that
the
things
they
had
been
taught
to
identify
with
their
bodies
their
families
their
political
parties
were
all
meaningless
temporary
distractions
as
perishable
as
a
garden
tomato
He
told
them
that
they
were
right
to
be
skeptical
of
this
material
world
its
squeaky-clean
suburbs
the
promise
of
happiness
wrapped
in
ribbons
of
credit
card
debt
He
knew
he
was
preaching
to
the
choir
Hippies
are
our
best
potential
he
said
according
to
his
biography
Swami
in
a
Strange
Land
Although
they
are
young
they
are
already
dissatisfied
…
and
frustrated
The
real
way
off
the
hamster
wheel
Prabhupada
promised
was
to
live
this
life
fully
absorbed
in
God
But
this
wasn
t
the
God
of
their
childhoods
that
stodgy
old
man
hidden
behind
a
thicket
of
facial
hair
this
was
Krishna
and
Krishna
was
just
like
them
Playful
and
joyful
and
young
Mischievous
and
even
a
little
libidinous
Better
yet
the
best
way
to
be
fully
absorbed
in
Krishna
was
through
song
and
dance
Prabhupada
introduced
them
to
kirtan
a
jubilant
ceremony
of
call-and-repeat
chanting
He
led
them
in
kirtans
beneath
an
elm
tree
in
Tompkins
Square
Park
a
photo
of
one
that
appeared
in
the
New
York
Times
effectively
introduced
the
rest
of
the
country
to
the
burgeoning
movement
During
his
first
year
in
the
U.
S.
Prabhupada
initiated
19
disciples
and
registered
ISKCON
the
International
Society
of
Krishna
Consciousness
as
a
nonprofit
tax-exempt
religious
organization
though
the
swami
insisted
that
his
movement
was
not
a
religion
nor
was
it
Hindu
but
rather
the
business
of
all
living
souls
In
1967
he
decamped
for
Haight-Ashbury
where
hundreds
of
hippies
flocked
to
a
recently
opened
temple
A
sign
above
the
temple
door
promised
they
could
STAY
HIGH
ALL
THE
TIME
FIND
ETERNAL
BLISS
Because
many
of
the
young
followers
were
transient
a
communal
structure
in
San
Francisco
emerged
that
would
serve
as
a
model
for
devotees
who
began
spreading
out
around
the
country
following
Prabhupada
s
edict
to
establish
more
temples
and
to
fill
them
with
recruits
That
same
year
two
of
Prabhupada
s
earliest
disciples
Keith
Ham
and
Howard
Wheeler
saw
an
ad
in
the
San
Francisco
Oracle
the
area
s
underground
newspaper
trying
to
form
an
ashram
of
sorts
here
in
West
Virginia
it
said
I
want
to
meet
one
two
or
any
number
of
people
who
would
be
willing
to
settle
here
and
devote
some
time
to
getting
the
thing
started
The
ad
had
been
placed
by
a
self-described
mystic
named
Richard
Rose
who
had
no
connection
to
the
Krishnas
just
a
lot
of
land
and
some
vague
notions
about
a
spiritual
retreat
Ham
and
Wheeler
traveled
to
West
Virginia
in
1967
and
negotiated
a
99-year
lease
on
a
remote
132-acre
farm
atop
McCreary
s
Ridge
Road
outside
the
Ohio
River
town
of
Moundsville
70
miles
south
of
Pittsburgh
At
Prabhupada
s
urging
they
named
their
inchoate
community
New
Vrindaban
A
few
months
later
the
Charleston
Gazette
reported
that
the
area
had
been
labeled
a
hippie
haven
by
nearby
residents
and
hippie-watching
had
become
a
popular
pastime
They
dance
on
the
roof
of
a
barn
at
night
the
article
continued
and
one
man
said
he
had
seen
them
talk
to
trees
The
second
time
I
went
to
New
Vrindaban
I
knew
what
to
expect
I
knew
to
fuel
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
to
download
an
album
before
cell
service
cut
out
I
knew
that
the
flambeau
above
a
natural
gas
compressor
station
was
not
the
moon
and
that
the
two-story
replica
of
the
Twin
Towers
in
someone
s
yard
was
in
fact
a
two-story
replica
of
the
Twin
Towers
in
someone
s
yard
its
tiny
windows
lit
up
in
patriotic
defiance
I
knew
to
expect
the
concrete
elephant
and
the
spangled
minarets
atop
Prabhupada
s
Palace
of
Gold
the
massive
temple
that
Ham
Wheeler
and
the
hundreds
of
devotees
who
flocked
to
New
Vrindaban
in
the
70s
built
to
honor
their
spiritual
master
Krishna
is
Watching
a
security
sign
read
as
I
pulled
into
the
registration
center
It
was
late
winter
and
an
extended
family
of
starlings
was
nesting
in
the
walls
of
the
cabin
I
rented
Guests
at
New
Vrindaban
can
choose
from
among
modest
motel
quarters
to
a
three-bedroom
cabin
overlooking
a
small
placid
lake
At
check-in
they
receive
a
schedule
of
the
day
s
events
any
of
which
they
are
welcome
to
attend
In
addition
to
four
daily
worship
ceremonies
visitors
can
watch
devotees
milk
cows
in
the
Goshala
where
a
tinny
recitation
of
the
maha-mantra
emanates
from
a
boombox
On
weekends
they
can
drop
in
on
Bhagavad
Gita
and
yoga
classes
or
explore
the
walking
paths
and
lotus
ponds
A
restaurant
called
Govinda
s
serves

fare
kids

pizza
and
nachos
A
gift
shop

South
Asian
bric-a-brac
ghee
bindis
prayer
beads
plastic
deities
shellacked

Technicolor
The
tidy
schedule
the
manicured
grounds
the
snack
machine
stuffed
with
sugary
carbs
nothing
about
New
Vrindaban
today
suggests
the
darkness
of
past
decades
nor
the
community
s
rough-and-tumble
beginnings
Prior
to
my
return
I
had
watched
grainy
film
reels
on
YouTube
of
baby-faced
devotees
carrying
buckets
of
water
through
winter
mud
tilling
fields
with
a
horse-drawn
plow
These
were
the
young
people
who
had
heeded
Prabhupada
s
1968
letter
in
which
he
entreated
stout
and
sturdy
devotees
to
West
Virginia
especially
those
with
carpentry
experience
and
[
who
]
can
do
manual
labor
Progress
was
slow
and
seasonal
When
Andy
Fraenkel
who
asked
to
be
referred
to
by
his
Sanskrit
name
Sankirtana
showed
up
in
1976
nobody
was
living
in
a
house
he
says
Instead
couples
and
families
were
camping
out
in
a
quartered-up
old
barn
sharing
a
bathroom
and
a
large
commercial
washer
Sankirtana
served
as
a
cook
preparing
food
over
an
open
fire
in
the
area
the
devotees
called
the
pits
using
the
creek
as
an
improvised
refrigerator
It
was
very
austere
he
remembers
Sankirtana
and
his
wife
who
considered
themselves
anti-establishment
hippies
had
for
years
resisted
fully
committing
to
the
Hare
Krishna
movement
they
had
discovered
and
admired
during
college
in
New
York
City
But
their
time
with
Prabhupada
who
was
actually
a
genuine
saintly
person
Sankirtana
contends
and
their
desire
for
simple
living
and
fellowship
eventually
convinced
them
to
join
the
community
No
matter
what
the
Charleston
Gazette
had
to
say
about
it
life
at
New
Vrindaban
wasn
t
easy
Nor
was
adhering
to
the
major
tenets
of
Krishna
Consciousness
which
Prabhupada
insisted
that
devotees
follow
as
they
began
cohabitating
unsupervised
Being
fully
immersed
in
Krishna
it
turned
out
didn
t
just
mean
singing
and
dancing
with
your
friends
it
meant
getting
up
at
4
a.
m
to
begin
chanting
renouncing
connections
to
the
material
world
and
abandoning
interests
that
couldn
t
be
put
to
good
use
in
the
community
Meat
was
off
the
table
as
were
alcohol
drugs
or
any
intoxicants
including
I
learned
on
that
first
grim
morning
coffee
Gambling
was
a
hard
no
and
celibacy
was
expected
except
for
married
couples
who
were
permitted
to
conjugate
for
purposes
of
procreation
but
only
after
chanting
for
five
hours
Regardless
Sankirtana
and
his
wife
liked
it
there
They
raised
two
children
at
New
Vrindaban
and
watched
as
the
community
grew
and
the
movement
gained
steam
While
devotees
shivered
through
merciless
mountain
winters
Krishna
Consciousness
was
pervading
the
world
they
had
left
behind
The

The

featured
prominently
in
the
musical
Hair
and
on
Stevie
Wonder
s
classic
1976
album
Songs
in
the
Key
of
Life
Prabhupada
also
enjoyed
celebrity
selling
millions
of
his
books
and
appearing
alongside
acts
like
the
Grateful
Dead
and
Moby
Grape
at
music
festivals
By
the
mid-
70s
he
was
circling
the
globe
on
a
speaking
tour
and
ISKCON
had
established
communities
and
temples
in
36
North
American
cities
Around
the
time
Sankirtana
arrived
at
New
Vrindaban
in
1976
the
community
was
beginning
to
show
hints
of
prosperity
Led
by
their
own
guru
Keith
Ham
devotees
had
built
two
temples
and
were
beginning
work
on
the
Palace
of
Gold
teaching
themselves
to
cut
marble
carve
wood
and
create
elaborate
stained
glass
windows
A
school
for
the
community
s
children
had
opened
as
had
the
cow
sanctuary
and
leaders
were
slowly
amassing
more
acres
using
a
few
local
sympathizers
to
sign
the
papers
since
most
area
residents
wouldn
t
sell
to
the
Krishnas
More
and
more
visitors
arrived
on
their
own
spiritual
pilgrimages
so
did
Malini
a
4-year-old
two-ton
Indian
elephant
supposedly
the
first
of
dozens
that
would
find
sanctuary
at
New
Vrindaban
The
community
actually
became
a
boomtown
Sankirtana
says
Seven
years
later
the
boomtown
would
go
bust
What
happened
next
is
contained
in
a
short
paragraph
inscribed
on
the
50-year
timeline
displayed
outside
New
Vrindaban
s
Temple
of
Understanding
The
difficulties
of
the
next
decade
were
prone
to
happen
it
says
deviant
tendencies
filtered
through
the
community
causing
dissension
and
distress
There
are
lots
of
opinions
about
when
the
trouble
started
Sankirtana
says
things
went
haywire
after
Keith
Ham
was
attacked
with
a
metal
pipe
by
a
disgruntled
fringie
the
name
given
to
devotees
who
hung
around
but
didn
t
adhere
to
the
movement
s
guiding
principles
Ham
spent
nearly
a
month
in
a
coma
suffering
brain
damage
that
permanently
affected
his
memory
and
altered
his
personality
He
attributed
his
improbable
survival
to
Lord
Nrsimhadeva
half
lion
half
man
whose
figure
he
said
appeared
in
his
brain
scan
Many
scholarly
accounts
like
E
Burke
Rochford
Jr.
s
book
Hare
Krishna
Transformed
argue
that
the
movement
as
a
whole
faltered
after
Prabhupada
s
death
in
1977
when
the
11
disciples
he
had
put
in
charge
established
what
became
known
as
the
zonal
acarya
system
exercising
exclusive
political
economic
and
spiritual
control
of
their
own
distinct
geographical
regions
Instead
of
initiating
devotees
on
Prabhupada
s
behalf
as
he
had
instructed
these
men
many
of
whom
were
in
their
20s
with
only
a
handful
of
years
in
the
movement
became
the
spiritual
masters
of
new
disciples
Each
guru
was
worshiped
as
if
he
was
god
himself
perched
upon
ornate
thrones
in
the
temple
where
they
lounged
while
devotees
honored
them
in
daily
ceremonies
with
flowers
incense
and
special
mantras
Still
others
like
former
devotee
and
New
Vrindaban
resident
Henry
Doktorski
say
that
the
trouble
was
baked
in
from
the
beginning
His
book
Killing
for
Krishna
is
an
exhaustive
tome
of
the
community
s
dysfunction
clocking
in
at
660
pages
and
corroborated
by
1,336
endnotes
Doktorski
s
book
includes
a
detail
that
is
often
missing
in
historical
accounts
of
New
Vrindaban
When
they
negotiated
the
lease
in
West
Virginia
in
1967
Ham
and
Wheeler
were
actually
at
odds
with
Prabhupada
after
Ham
had
attempted
to
wrest
power
from
the
ISKCON
founder
while
he
was
sick
in
India
going
so
far
as
to
sell
one
of
Prabhupada
s
manuscripts
under
his
own
name
When
Prabhupada
chastised
him
publicly
writing
to
followers
that
Ham
was
a
crazy
man
Ham
printed
up
stationery
for
an
organization
called
First
United
Church
of
Krishna
Youth
Organization
Underground
FUCK
YOU
so
that
he
could
send
less-than-subtle
messages
to
his
estranged
spiritual
master
Prabhupada
forgave
his
prodigal
disciples
around
the
time
they
secured
those
132
muddy
acres
but
Ham
s
reign
at
New
Vrindaban
would
be
characterized
by
the
same
audacity
and
self-aggrandizement
he
had
demonstrated
during
that
defection
Doktorski
says
that
long
before
Prabhupada
s
death
or
Ham
s
head
injury
the
community
wasn
t
just
rife
with
deviant
tendencies
it
ran
on
them
Doktorski
was
22
when
he
arrived
at
New
Vrindaban
in
1978
a
recent
college
graduate
with
a
bachelor
of
arts
degree
that
included
double
majors
in
piano
performance
and
music
education
He
was
interested
in
Eastern
thought
he
says
already
a
vegetarian
who
read
Ram
Dass
and
the
Bhagavad
Gita
Doktorski
was
on
his
way
to
graduate
school
in
Texas
when
he
got
off
the
freeway
in
West
Virginia
struggling
with
deep
insecurity
I
had
some
disappointments
in
college
he
says
and
a
negative
experience
with
a
girlfriend
He
was
also
harboring
great
doubts
about
his
future
as
a
musician
I
was
ripe
for
joining
a
cult
Doktorski
was
initiated
by
Ham
in
the
spring
of
1979
taking
the
name
Hrishikesh
Dasa
which
means
servant
of
the
master
of
the
senses
Right
away
Ham
sent
the
young
devotee
on
the
road
where
he
would
spend
six
years
living
out
of
vans
and
working
as
a
picker
Picking
was
a
polite
euphemism
for
the
illegal
fundraising
devotees
undertook
on
the
road
selling
counterfeit
sports
memorabilia
and
soliciting
for
non-existent
charities
at
places
like
concerts
and
corner
stores
Doktorski
says
that
picking
created
enormous
profits
$
12
5
million
dollars
between
1981
and
1985
alone
that
were
used
to
bankroll
the
community
Prabhupada
s
Palace
of
Gold
Doktorski
alleges
was
financed
through
the
sale
of
high-quality
hashish
smuggled
from
Afghanistan
Women
especially
were
expected
to
excel
at
picking
or
face
consequences
If
a
woman
didn
t
make
her
quota
Doktorski
writes
the
[
picking
]
leader
might
slap
her
around
a
little
Women
faced
violence
at
home
too
Wife
beating
was
not
uncommon
at
New
Vrindaban
and
even
encouraged
by
Ham
according
to
Doktorski
Indeed
Ham
and
other
ISKCON
gurus
had
nothing
to
gain
from
devotees
enjoying
an
insular
or
idyllic
family
life
In
the
eight
years
after
Prabhupada
s
death
in
1977
the
movement
had
lost
an
estimated
three-quarters
of
his
disciples
and
was
no
longer
cashing
in
on
his
book
sales
To
sustain
the
communities
they
had
spent
decades
building
and
safeguard
their
own
power
the
gurus
needed
devotees
in
the
temple
or
on
the
road
If
devotees
insisted
on
becoming
householders
those
who
married
and
lived
outside
the
communal
structures
of
the
movement
those
marriages
were
typically
arranged
by
leadership
who
often
conspired
to
match
partners
based
on
ISKCON
s
economic
need
rather
than
compatibility
Lucrative
pickers
for
example
were
placed
in
marriages
that
would
not
hinder
their
service
Likewise
any
children
the
marriage
produced
were
essentially
community
property
At
New
Vrindaban
that
meant
parents
were
admonished
to
deposit
their
children
in
the
community
nursery
and
residential
school
or
so
the
saying
went
dump
the
load
and
hit
the
road
Instead
of
an
institution
meant
to
train
and
educate
the
gurukula
became
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
orphanage
according
to
Rochford
The
combination
of
distracted
parents
untrained
teachers
and
nonexistent
oversight
led
to
rampant
malfeasance
Studies
carried
out
in
the
late
90s
revealed
that
a
quarter
of
students
in
ISKCON
s
11
gurukulas
were
sexually
abused
a
third
of
students
reported
being
physically
abused
By
1986
all
ashram-based
gurukulas
in
North
America
were
shuttered
Ham
however
continued
to
host
a
private
ashram
in
his
home
full
of
teenage
boys
who
he
spent
many
unsupervised
evenings
with
It
was
well-known
that
Ham
enjoyed
numerous
sexual
relationships
with
young
laborers
the
community
employed
not
to
mention
alcohol
marijuana
and
cocaine
While
Prabhubada
certainly
would
have
condemned
Ham
s
decadence
and
lechery
he
also
left
behind
a
trove
of
letters
and
literature
that
in
many
ways
gave
rise
to
the
community
s
dysfunction
In
his
writings
Prabhupada
suggested
that
women
had
smaller
brains
than
men
and
should
think
of
their
husbands
as
the
Supreme
Lord
insisted
on
residential
–
not
day
–
schools
and
Doktorski
points
out
preached
that
one
day
when
ISKCON
ruled
the
planet
Krishna
Conscious
soldiers
would
kill
all
the
mudhas
the
Sanskrit
word
for
fools
We
are
not
nonviolent
Prabhupada
confessed
We
are
violent
to
the
mudhas
At
around
1
a.
m
on
Thursday
May
22
1986
a
33-year-old
devotee
named
Steven
Bryant
parked
his
boxy
Dodge
conversion
van
near
the
intersection
of
Cardiff
and
Flint
Avenues
in
Culver
City
California
An
almost
full
moon
traced
shadows
of
palm
and
Chinese
elm
trees
onto
the
tile
roofs
of
darkened
homes
and
made
it
easy
for
Bryant
to
see
the
joint
he
was
assembling
in
his
lap
The
morning
was
still
and
cool
about
60
degrees
so
he
may
have
had
his
window
rolled
down
He
may
have
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
van
He
may
have
looked
up
and
recognized
the
sad
eyes
and
pinched
lips
of
Thomas
Drescher
an
old
buddy
from
New
Vrindaban
Chant
Hare
Krishna
because
you
re
about
to
die
Drescher
reportedly
said
before
shooting
Bryant
twice
in
the
face
It
was
the
second
murder
Drescher
had
carried
out
for
Keith
Ham
The
first
had
occurred
three
years
before
Bryant
bled
out
on
that
quiet
Culver
City
street
Like
Bryant
Charles
St
Denis
had
been
loudly
and
rightly
accusing
Ham
of
breaking
the
movement
s
regulative
principles
and
worse
doing
so
with
underage
boys
In
1983
Drescher
had
shot
St
Denis
outside
New
Vrindaban
s
art
studio
and
buried
his
body
beneath
a
stony
creek
bed
In
West
Virginia
local
authorities
suspicious
of
the
hippy
haven
from
the
jump
had
been
monitoring
Ham
s
enterprise
for
years
they
felt
confident
enough
that
the
missing
St
Denis
had
been
murdered
but
the
lack
of
a
body
hampered
their
investigation
When
the
LAPD
whose
own
inquiry
into
Bryant
s
death
had
led
them
immediately
to
the
nearby
ISKCON
temple
in
Los
Angeles
called
and
asked
for
their
assistance
officials
in
West
Virginia
finally
had
the
information
they
needed
to
make
their
move
As
Drescher
hid
out
in
Ohio
and
waited
for
the
$
8,000
he
had
been
promised
for
his
second
hit
police
knocked
on
the
door
of
his
mobile
home
Five
days
after
he
shot
Bryant
Drescher
was
arrested
on
a
felony
warrant
for
the
murder
of
St
Denis
Six
months
later
around
the
time
he
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
the
FBI
swarmed
New
Vrindaban
filling
three
semi-trailers
full
of
filing
cabinets
financial
records
and
a
cache
of
counterfeit
sports
memorabilia
In
the
fall
1986
the
community
laid
off
their
entire
187-member
workforce
The
Marshall
County
Sheriff
told
the
local
newspaper
This
is
the
end
of
New
Vrindaban
as
we
know
it
Despite
a
25-million-dollar
lawsuit
from
major
league
sports
teams
as
well
as
an
11-count
indictment
that
included
racketeering
mail
fraud
and
conspiracy
to
murder
Ham
remained
serene
He
weathered
trials
and
convictions
appeals
and
house
arrest
with
help
from
high-powered
high-cost
attorneys
like
Alan
Dershowitz
and
Greta
Van
Susteren
draining
what
little
money
remained
in
the
coffers
at
New
Vrindaban
He
went
on
Larry
King
Live
and
insisted
that
the
case
against
him
was
fueled
by
anti-Hindu
sentiments
while
at
the
same
time
ushering
in
an
interfaith
era
at
New
Vrindaban
he
called
the
City
of
God
Ham
asked
devotees
to
wear
Franciscan
robes
and
Doktorski
by
then
the
community
s
music
director
to
play
the
accordion
in
new
Christianized
Krishna
hymns
A
statue
of
Jesus
his
legs
twisted
into
a
lotus
position
was
placed
in
the
temple
Through
it
all
Doktorski
and
about
100
other
devotees
stayed
loyal
to
their
spiritual
master
Sankirtana
says
he
was
too
lazy
and
too
stubborn
to
leave
something
that
I
already
devoted
twenty
years
to
Doktorski
stayed
simply
because
he
couldn
t
say
no
to
the
guru
By
the
fall
of
1993
Ham
had
beat
all
the
charges
in
time
to
celebrate
his
56th
birthday
at
New
Vrindaban
but
the
occasion
was
spoiled
by
some
alarming
news
from
Ham
s
chauffeur
He
confided
that
on
a
long
drive
back
from
a
conference
in
Chicago
the
privacy
curtain
of
the
exonerated
guru
s
Winnebago
had
fallen
open
to
reveal
Ham
in
bed
with
a
teenage
disciple
That
was
the
last
straw
for
Doktorski
he
left
the
community
soon
after
Sankirtana
and
his
wife
remained
Ham
would
eventually
be
retried
and
serve
eight
years
in
prison
for
mail
fraud
and
racketeering
He
died
of
kidney
failure
in
Mumbai
on
October
24
2011
surrounded
by
Indian
devotees
who
during
their
spiritual
master
s
infirm
final
days
had
purchased
him
a
motorized
wheelchair
Gopal
Campu
Dasa
was
born
in
New
York
City
to
Dominican
parents
who
named
him
Cesar
By
the
time
he
turned
20
in
2014
Gopal
Campu
was
a
full-time
car
salesman
with
all
the
things
money
can
buy
But
he
was
miserable
My
life
was
lacking
substance
he
says
Before
he
found
the
Bhagavad
Gita
he
found
Eat
Pray
Love
which
he
summarizes
for
me
succinctly
In
there
this
lady
she
goes
through
a
one-year
mid-life
crisis
and
she
decides
to
travel
At
some
point
she
got
in
contact
with
the
Bhagavad
Gita
and
that
helped
her
overcome
obstacles
she
was
facing
at
the
time
Gopal
Campu
figured
that
if
these
ancient
Vedic
texts
helped
Elizabeth
Gilbert
maybe
they
could
help
him
too
He
found
a
used
copy
but
didn
t
get
around
to
reading
it
until
his
youngest
sister
suffered
a
stroke
I
was
like
‘
my
God
what
is
the
point
of
life
I
can
die
tomorrow
…
I
just
had
this
overwhelming
desire
to
go
home
and
read
the
Bhagavad
Gita
One
year
later
he
quit
his
job
and
moved
into
the
ISKCON
temple
in
Brooklyn
where
he
says
I
just
felt
at
home
Gopal
Campu
s
Caribbean
family
thought
he
was
getting
into
some
voodoo
They
teased
him
about
wearing
a
dress
You
re
definitely
losing
it
they
said
There
is
something
wrong
with
you
But
six
years
later
Gopal
Campu
says
even
his
family
can
see
that
he
s
developed
into
a
real
person
Today
Gopal
Campu
is
27
and
spends
much
of
his
time
proselytizing
distributing
literature
in
airports
and
subway
stations
and
hosting
kirtans
in
the
streets
of
New
York
City
and
posting
them
on
his
Instagram
page
which
has
33,000
followers
When
I
met
him
he
had
traveled
to
New
Vrindaban
with
friends
to
take
part
in
the
annual
24-hour
kirtan
just
one
of
the
community
s
many
festivals
that
brings
in
a
deluge
of
visitors
and
cash
Events
like
it
have
been
a
significant
part
of
righting
the
ship
and
regaining
financial
footing
after
the
shame
and
struggle
of
the
last
century
These
days
New
Vrindaban
is
a
big
player
in
regional
tourism
too
holding
a
well-attended
parade
in
Wheeling
every
summer
and
an
even
more
popular
Holi
festival
each
fall
The
community
is
even
a
stop
on
the
Moundsville
Area
visitors
shuttle
which
includes
other
attractions
like
the
old
state
penitentiary
and
an
ancient
Adena
burial
mound
Fiscal
recovery
hasn
t
been
all
fun
and
festivals
though
Doktorski
calls
the
late
90s
the
Dark
Age
of
New
Vrindaban
Kicked
out
of
ISKCON
and
without
a
spiritual
leader
or
a
way
to
raise
money
the
community
survived
by
hawking
just
about
everything
that
wasn
t
bolted
to
the
floor
Two
organs
and
six
bronze
bells
from
the
bell
tower
Bulldozers
and
dump
trucks
Steel
for
scrap
and
a
long-buried
chest
of
gold
Four
deities
went
to
a
temple
in
New
Jersey
and
Yoga
Jesus
ended
up
well
God
knows
where
Malini
the
elephant
was
sold
to
the
circus
Next
on
the
auction
block
was
land
No
longer
able
to
support
communal
residents
community
leaders
sold
acres
to
devotees
on
which
to
build
their
own
homes
where
they
could
park
the
cars
they
would
need
for
the
jobs
they
would
inevitably
have
to
find
some
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
20
years
Instead
of
living
in
the
temple
or
spending
hours
there
each
day
they
would
now
practice
their
faith
the
way
the
majority
of
us
do
in
between
other
things
when
it
s
convenient
for
us
They
had
been
evicted
kicked
back
out
into
the
material
world
they
had
left
behind
so
long
ago
Meanwhile
this
transition
from
commune
to
congregation
was
happening
in
ISKCON
communities
around
the
world
While
Ham
s
scandals
inspired
the
most
headlines
by
2005
nine
of
the
11
gurus
who
took
over
after
Prabhupada
s
death
had
been
expelled
from
the
movement
one
for
an
illegal
weapons
charge
another
for
allegedly
using
LSD
to
hold
extended
ecstatic
kirtans
ISKCON
had
lost
its
social
and
financial
grip
on
devotees
but
growing
congregationalism
wasn
t
all
bad
Now
that
total
renunciation
was
no
longer
a
requisite
for
membership
new
faces
began
appearing
at
the
temple
New
Vrindaban
on
a
Thursday
looks
very
different
from
New
Vrindaban
on
a
Friday
During
the
week
the
community
is
quiet
full
of
head-down
devotees
who
I
couldn
t
help
but
notice
are
mostly
white
On
Fridays
things
get
more
diverse
South
Asian
and
Hindu
Americans
arrive
in
minivans
full
of
kids
their
license
plates
bearing
the
names
of
surrounding
states
They
wear
jeans
and
T-shirts
and
flout
the
temple
s
no-photography
rule
pointing
their
smartphones
at
children
beaming
in
front
of
beflowered
deities
It
wasn
t
always
like
this
Prabhupada
himself
ignored
Indian
immigrants
in
America
fearing
that
ISKCON
would
be
overly
identified
with
Hinduism
according
to
Rochford
But
as
Krishna
Consciousness
took
root
in
the
United
States
Hindu
Americans
were
drawn
to
its
communities
and
temples
not
necessarily
for
spiritual
reasons
but
as
a
way
to
maintain
cultural
traditions
and
ethnic
identities
Over
time
ISKCON
leadership
began
to
see
the
benefit
that
Hindus
brought
leaning
heavily
on
those
members
to
speak
up
in
response
to
allegations
that
the
movement
was
cult
More
importantly
Hindu
Americans
had
money
homeless
hippies
generally
did
not
By
2005
by
Rochford
s
estimate
some
95
percent
of
monetary
donations
originated
from
immigrant
pocketbooks
Hindu
influence
has
helped
ISKCON
survive
but
also
changed
the
culture
of
Krishna
Consciousness
Because
Hindu
Americans
are
more
likely
to
visit
ISKCON
communities
for
social
purposes
while
Western
devotees
typically
arrive
for
impassioned
spiritual
pursuits
schisms
have
erupted
over
which
deities
should
occupy
the
temple
and
how
raucous
a
kirtan
really
needs
to
be
At
New
Vrindaban
the
tension
between
fundamentalism
and
cash
flow
were
on
display
again
in
2010
when
the
community
signed
a
contract
with
AB
Resources
allowing
the
natural
gas
company
to
begin
fracking
the
land
beneath
devotees
bare
feet
But
for
young
people
like
Gopal
Campu
these
factional
disputes
are
just
distractions
from
devotees
real
work
which
is
understanding
where
they
stand
in
relation
to
Krishna
not
each
other
not
temple
etiquette
or
fracking
leases
As
our
guru
would
say
Gopal
Campu
told
me
you
have
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
The
last
time
I
visit
New
Vrindaban
in
the
spring
of
2021
I
blow
my
cover
and
come
as
a
journalist
I
reach
out
to
Anuradha
Dasi
the
community
s
communications
director
and
tell
her
I
am
interested
in
talking
to
young
people
who
have
recently
joined
the
movement
Anuradha
is
aggressively
helpful
emailing
possible
sources
before
we
get
off
the
phone
During
my
weekend
at
the
community
where
I
spend
most
of
my
time
conducting
interviews
at
a
picnic
table
outside
the
temple
I
often
see
Anuradha
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
shepherding
another
innocent
my
way
One
of
them
is
Marissa
Stakeley
a
20-year-old
new
arrival
from
Pittsburgh
s
suburbs
Stakeley
speaks
in
hurried
excited
fragments
like
someone
whose
cell
phone
is
about
to
die
Wearing
a
tan
sari
and
lacy
gold
earrings
the
size
of
silver
dollars
she
strikes
me
as
painfully
young
At
one
point
during
our
interview
a
carful
of
boys
drives
by
honking
and
waving
Oh
my
gosh
Stakeley
says
leaning
close
on
her
forearms
were
they
looking
at
us
Sixteen
years
her
senior
I
feel
confident
letting
Stakeley
know
they
were
looking
at
her
When
I
ask
how
she
found
her
way
to
New
Vrindaban
Stakeley
says
she
came
in
distress
The
pandemic
exacerbated
her
despair
over
the
America
of
her
young
adulthood
The
world
is
ending
around
me
she
says
I
need
to
understand
my
purpose
After
meeting
a
devotee
at
a
yoga
retreat
Stakeley
began
visiting
the
community
on
the
weekends
and
in
between
classes
at
a
local
college
where
she
s
majoring
in
sustainability
At
first
she
thought
the
devotees
might
help
her
get
started
in
the
kind
of
work
she
wants
to
do
building
self-sufficient
and
off-the-grid
communities
But
soon
she
made
friends
at
New
Vrindaban
I
was
praying
for
some
community
she
recalls
just
some
people
who
would
talk
to
me
and
actually
care
about
some
things
that
I
cared
about
She
decided
to
spend
the
summer
of
2021
living
in
the
ashram
to
develop
her
spirituality
Stakeley
s
father
doesn
t
really
know
the
details
of
her
living
arrangements
she
says
Her
mother
passed
away
in
2018
briefly
talking
about
her
is
the
only
time
during
the
hour
we
spend
together
that
Stakeley
s
eyes
and
voice
lower
She
tells
me
that
her
mom
was
strongly
intuitive
and
taught
her
daughter
to
harness
her
own
instinct
Just
because
I
m
young
doesn
t
mean
I
m
not
intelligent
or
wise
Stakeley
insists
Being
young
probably
makes
celibacy
more
difficult
though
and
Stakeley
admits
that
for
a
while
she
had
developed
an
unrequited
crush
on
a
male
devotee
Then
after
many
nights
of
torment
and
prayer
she
remembered
a
ring
that
she
had
brought
with
her
a
loud
sparkling
thing
she
plays
with
for
most
of
our
interview
They
ll
never
want
to
put
a
ring
on
my
finger
but
I
know
Krishna
will
I
think
of
it
like
I
m
engaged
to
God
It
s
one
of
the
stranger
things
someone
has
told
me
but
it
makes
more
sense
when
Stakeley
says
she
thinks
young
people
like
her
are
drawn
to
Krishna
Consciousness
because
it
offers
them
an
escape
from
the
outrageous
pressures
of
growing
up
It
s
just
a
relief
Stakeley
sighs
We
have
these
social
constructs
in
American
society
First
step
school
Next
step
job
Next
step
marriage
Next
step
kids
Next
step
death
she
counts
these
steps
on
her
fingers
At
New
Vrindaban
Stakeley
tells
me
It
s
first
step
develop
your
love
of
God
Next
step
continue
These
conflicting
urges
to
be
held
securely
yet
completely
free
remind
me
of
my
own
youth
Don
t
they
remind
you
of
yours
too
It
s
not
hard
to
trace
a
line
from
the
early
pioneers
of
New
Vrindaban
to
kids
like
Stakeley
seekers
fueled
by
an
idealism
dwarfed
only
by
their
own
existential
terror
Of
course
this
doesn
t
make
me
feel
less
worried
for
Stakeley
an
eager
young
woman
on
her
own
in
a
community
full
of
celibate
men
In
fact
over
the
next
few
months
I
ll
prowl
around
social
media
looking
for
traces
of
her
I
ll
email
her
twice
but
she
never
writes
back
The
next
day
at
the
morning
arati
I
take
a
seat
in
the
back
and
watch
as
devotees
file
in
and
fall
prostrate
on
the
floor
before
the
statue
of
Prabhupada
who
nests
deep
in
a
throne
on
the
east
wall
of
the
temple
dressed
in
a
sunset-pink
robe
and
matching
socks
Some
chose
an
instrument
from
the
table
nearby
hand
cymbals
or
khols
before
joining
the
group
assembled
near
a
microphone
females
on
the
left
males
on
the
right
The
ceremony
begins
with
a
song
for
the
deities
Krishna
and
Radha
who
receive
freshly
laundered
clothing
and
freshly
cut
flowers
each
day
The
next
song
is
for
Prabhupada
and
devotees
line
up
to
deposit
rose
petals
into
the
bowl
beneath
his
feet
rubbing
his
sock
before
they
hurry
away
as
if
for
good
luck
Soon
a
full-blown
kirtan
has
begun
and
I
attempt
a
respectful
sway
Anuradha
looks
back
and
I
wave
happily
hoping
the
gesture
will
communicate
that
I
m
just
fine
standing
here
swaying
observing
all
by
myself
Of
course
it
doesn
t
and
soon
she
s
at
my
side
Do
you
want
to
come
dance
with
us
she
says
over
the
noise
Anuradha
takes
my
fingers
in
her
tiny
palm
She
leads
me
across
the
gleaming
parquet
floors
until
we
are
a
part
of
the
small
throng
of
women
near
the
altar
Most
of
them
look
like
me
white
30-something
tired
They
wear
saris
and
move
in
a
coordinated
way
that
reminds
me
of
the
easy
part
of
the
Electric
Slide
a
choreography
I
am
relieved
to
find
I
can
reasonably
imitate
At
first
the
men
who
have
the
instruments
and
the
microphone
seem
to
have
all
the
fun
yanking
their
knees
into
their
chests
in
great
bursts
of
joy
as
if
the
floor
is
on
fire
But
as
the
chant
speeds
up
and
the
drums
grow
louder
the
ladies
find
more
vigor
grinning
at
each
other
knowingly
Suddenly
they
we
are
moving
in
a
wide
circle
skirts
really
rippling
now
like
flags
in
a
storm
I
concentrate
on
the
scapula
of
the
woman
in
front
of
me
where
the
tip
of
a
blue-black
butterfly
wing
is
emerging
from
the
satin
thrown
over
her
shoulder
The
whole
thing
feels
like
a
birthday
party
All
the
colors
and
the
costumes
Songs
that
everybody
knows
by
heart
even
by
this
point
it
turns
out
me
Before
I
notice
I
am
really
dancing
really
smiling
really
singing
Hare
Krishna

Reader
I
felt
so
many
things
Above
all
else
silly
More
Catholic
than
I
had
in
a
long
time
midwestern
as
always
Unmoved
unchanged
unbelieving
But
I
did
not
feel
sad
I
did
not
for
the
first
time
in
many
hours
worry
about
how
I
would
write
this
story
or
if
I
could
write
it
well
I
didn
t
worry
about
home
if
the
dog
walker
had
shown
up
or
if
my
partner
had
turned
the
AC
down
I
didn
t
worry
about
my
parents
contracting
COVID
or
my
best
friend
s
kids
as
climate
change
and
political
belligerence
dismantles
any
recognizable
version
of
the
reality
they
will
inherit
I
did
not
worry
I
did
not
feel
sad
The
world
is
full
of
make-believe
Some
of
it
is
sweet
some
of
it
is
sick
and
some
of
it
s
just
downright
preposterous
It
persists
of
course
it
persists
because
we
have
found
no
other
antidote
for
pain
Mothers
die
fathers
become
addicts
sisters
have
strokes
pandemics
and
hurricanes
stalk
the
land
That
I
wondered
how
New
Vrindaban
had
weathered
its
scandals
seems
naive
to
me
now
a
question
with
a
million
personal
and
tragic
answers
When
I
meet
Trevor
Krenzelak
at
that
picnic
table
outside
the
temple
he
s
wearing
white
not
saffron
a
nod
to
the
relationship
he
s
recently
begun
with
another
devotee
We
catch
up
for
a
while
about
his
family
and
his
life
at
the
temple
he
tells
me
he
still
goes
to
the
skatepark
once
a
week
or
so
but
not
in
his
dhoti
Before
we
say
goodbye
I
ask
Krenzelak
what
bearing
if
any
the
past
has
on
life
at
New
Vrindaban
today
He
says
whatever
happened
before
still
lingers
but
that
the
residue
of
scandal
actually
performs
a
gatekeeping
function
for
the
community
It
serves
as
a
natural
filter
for
the
sincere
people
If
people
aren
t
really
interested
in
Krishna
then
they
re
going
to
get
absorbed
in
hearing
criticism
and
negative
things
…
and
go
away
But
if
you
really
want
to
know
about
Krishna
then
Krishna
is
here
It
s
such
a
masterful
rhetorical
maneuver
I
am
tempted
to
applaud
But
isn
t
that
what
we
all
do
repackage
our
sins
as
sentinels
weave
our
pain
into
some
larger
self-affirming
narrative
the
very
reason
we
can
persevere
at
all
Give
thanks
for
those
troubles
we
tell
ourselves
they
made
you
who
you
are
today
I
know
that
weekend
will
be
my
last
in
Krishna
Land
As
I
drive
down
the
mountain
my
senses
are
heightened
every
sight
an
easy
and
willing
symbol
The
billboards
trumpeting
the
arrival
of
high-speed
internet
The
front
yards
full
of
obscene
political
slogans
The
scar
of
a
freshly
buried
pipeline
On
the
radio
an
old
man
recites
the
Stations
of
the
Cross
At
a
convenience
store
a
young
man
buys
a
stack
of
lottery
tickets
The
maha-mantra
coils
through
my
brain
as
the
road
unspools
before
me
thin
and
vanishing
like
the
line
between
faith
and
delusion

For
most
residents
of
Holland
Michigan
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
March
11
1989
a
Saturday
Frost
on
the
ladders
of
the
city
s
water
towers
thawed
in
the
sun—spring
was
just
over
a
week
away
Mothers
poured
milk
over
cereal
for
kids
watching
back-to-back
episodes
of
their
favorite
cartoons
Fathers
who
worked
weekends
drove
pickup
trucks
to
industrial
jobs
at
local
automotive
and
concrete
companies
But
all
was
not
well
in
the
house
on
the
corner
of
Lincoln
Road
and
52nd
Street
It
belonged
to
Dennis
and
Brenda
Bowman
a
married
couple
with
two
children
For
the
Bowmans
March
11
marked
the
last
time
they
saw
their
14-year-old
daughter
Aundria
alive
Dennis
was
the
one
who
contacted
the
police
He
told
them
that
he
d
come
home
from
his
job
as
a
wood
machinist
to
find
Aundria
missing
along
with
some
of
her
belongings
and
$
100
from
his
dresser
Dennis
described
Aundria—whom
he
and
Brenda
had
adopted
when
she
was
an
infant—as
a
troubled
teenager
who
frequently
fought
with
her
mother
and
had
run
away
to
a
friend
s
house
once
before
Dennis
agreed
to
call
around
to
the
homes
of
kids
Aundria
knew
to
find
out
if
anyone
had
seen
her
But
his
wife
soon
took
over
as
the
family
s
point
of
contact
It
was
Brenda
who
called
the
police
regularly
and
Brenda
who
corrected
the
amount
of
cash
missing
from
her
husband
s
dresser
to
$
150
That
was
enough
for
police
to
issue
a
warrant
for
Aundria
s
arrest
for
larceny
the
warrant
listed
Dennis
as
the
victim
of
his
daughter
s
alleged
crime
With
no
foul
play
suspected
the
police
labeled
Aundria
a
runaway
and
passed
her
case
along
to
the
Youth
Services
Bureau
Few
people
who
knew
the
Bowmans
questioned
the
official
narrative
Over
the
years
there
had
been
whispers
about
the
family
Once
when
Aundria
was
in
middle
school
she
boarded
the
school
bus
bleeding
from
her
wrist
Some
kids
gossiped
about
a
suicide
attempt
but
others
said
Aundria
had
cut
herself
trying
to
get
back
into
her
house
after
her
parents
locked
her
out
There
were
rumors
that
Dennis
a
former
Navy
reservist
with
reddish-brown
hair
a
goatee
and
wire-rimmed
glasses
and
Brenda
a
portly
woman
with
curled
bangs
who
d
once
worked
at
the
jewelry
counter
at
Meijer
department
store
abused
Aundria
But
back
then
what
happened
behind
closed
doors
was
considered
family
business
Fifteen
months
before
Aundria
disappeared
Brenda
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
Vanessa
Aundria
went
from
being
an
only
child
to
more
than
a
big
sister—she
was
a
third
parent
to
the
chubby
redheaded
baby
While
other
kids
her
age
went
to
afterschool
clubs
and
Friday
night
football
games
Aundria
stayed
home
changing
diapers
and
cleaning
bottles
She
kept
a
photo
of
her
sister
in
a
school
folder
where
other
teens
might
stash
a
magazine
cutout
or
a
polaroid
of
their
crush
When
she
wasn
t
with
Vanessa
Aundria
was
anxious
about
the
baby
s
well-being
Many
people
in
Holland
assumed
that
Aundria
had
gotten
so
fed
up
with
her
home
life
that
she
finally
split
Maybe
she
d
gone
looking
for
her
birth
mother
People
heard
that
she
d
hitched
a
ride
at
a
local
truck
stop
had
left
town
with
an
older
boy
or
was
pregnant
Brenda
reported
a
series
of
tips
in
the
weeks
and
months
following
her
daughter
s
disappearance
all
of
which
seemed
to
confirm
that
Aundria
had
run
away
At
the
end
of
March
Brenda
claimed
Aundria
had
been
spotted
at
a
7-Eleven
In
mid-April
Brenda
said
she
received
an
anonymous
call
from
someone
claiming
that
police
were
looking
for
the
teenager
in
the
right
area
but
on
the
wrong
street—whatever
that
meant
In
June
she
reported
a
sighting
at
a
local
property
where
Aundria
had
supposedly
been
hanging
out
with
a
group
of
young
men
And
in
October
Brenda
said
a
friend
had
seen
Aundria
pregnant
and
with
dyed
hair
in
a
line
at
Meijer
Police
investigated
but
found
nothing
Aundria
s
classmates
went
to
prom
and
graduated
then
got
jobs
or
headed
to
college
Eventually
they
married
and
had
children
of
their
own
But
Aundria
remained
forever
14
A
single
photograph
formed
most
people
s
memory
of
her
It
was
given
to
police
when
she
first
vanished
In
it
Aundria
is
sitting
against
a
blue
studio
backdrop
and
looking
just
off
camera
with
her
green
eyes
cast
hopefully
upward
and
pieces
of
her
dark
shaggy
hair
hanging
over
her
forehead
Her
smile
is
charmingly
off-balanced
She
looks
suspended
between
adolescence
and
adulthood
Photos
of
missing
children
were
often
printed
on
the
sides
of
milk
cartons
or
on
flyers
taped
to
the
top
of
pizza
delivery
boxes
Aundria
s
picture
wound
up
somewhere
else
In
1993
the
band
Soul
Asylum
debuted
a
music
video
for
its
song
Runaway
Train
featuring
the
images
and
names
of
missing
kids
across
America
The
video
was
a
huge
hit
with
several
versions
airing
on
MTV
and
VH1
In
the
one
that
played
in
Michigan
Aundria
s
photo
appears
just
after
the
two-minute
mark
Reflecting
on
the
video
20
years
after
its
release
director
Tony
Kaye
claimed
that
more
than
two
dozen
missing
children
were
found
because
of
the
video
Aundria
Bowman
wasn
t
one
of
them
Back
then
what
happened
behind
closed
doors
was
considered
family
business
Carl
Koppelman
never
expected
to
solve
mysteries
He
worked
as
an
accountant
until
2009
when
his
mother
s
health
began
to
decline
At
46
Koppelman
became
a
full-time
caregiver
and
his
days
once
filled
with
reviews
of
spreadsheets
and
financial
statements
now
revolved
around
driving
to
doctor
s
appointments
and
administering
medications
When
he
wasn
t
tending
to
his
mother
Koppelman
was
online
exploring
message
boards
news
sites
and
social
media
At
the
time
the
story
dominating
headlines
and
bordering
on
popular
obsession
was
the
return
of
Jaycee
Dugard
In
1991
Dugard
had
been
kidnapped
while
walking
to
a
bus
stop
near
her
home
south
of
Lake
Tahoe
California
The
blond
freckled
11-year-old
was
the
subject
of
a
nationwide
search
but
eventually
the
case
went
cold
Then
on
August
26
2009
Dugard
reappeared
For
18
years
convicted
sex
offender
Philip
Garrido
and
his
wife
Nancy
had
held
her
captive
at
their
home
in
the
town
of
Antioch
more
than
150
miles
from
where
they
d
kidnapped
her
Dugard
had
given
birth
to
two
of
Garrido
s
daughters
who
were
now
11
and
15
To
the
embarrassment
of
local
authorities
parole
officers
had
visited
the
Garridos
home
several
times
during
the
years
Dugard
was
missing
They
d
failed
to
check
the
backyard
where
the
young
woman
was
kept
in
a
network
of
tents
lean-tos
and
sheds
Koppelman
s
interest
in
the
Dugard
case
led
him
to
Websleuths
a
forum
where
crime
hobbyists
and
armchair
detectives
connect
and
collaborate
on
unsolved
cases
Koppelman
gravitated
to
posts
about
cold
cases
the
ones
least
likely
to
ever
be
solved
Until
recently
Dugard
s
had
been
one
of
them
How
many
more
would
benefit
from
fresh
eyes
and
a
little
persistence
Koppelman
spent
countless
hours
scrolling
through
the
national
database
of
missing
persons
and
unidentified
bodies
known
as
NamUs
There
s
overlap
between
the
two
main
parts
of
the
database
the
disappeared
and
the
deceased—the
trick
is
finding
it
During
late
nights
at
his
computer
in
a
dimly
lit
corner
of
his
mother
s
suburban
home
in
El
Segundo
California
Koppelman
would
try
to
match
the
characteristics
of
people
who
had
gone
missing
with
those
of
the
unidentified
dead
Finding
a
likeness
could
be
enough
to
generate
a
tip
for
law
enforcement
When
Koppelman
noticed
that
the
age
and
condition
of
some
bodies
might
make
it
difficult
for
loved
ones
to
recognize
them
it
sparked
an
idea
Koppelman
liked
to
draw
portraits
for
fun
and
he
was
pretty
good
at
it
He
also
had
a
CD-ROM
of
the
image-editing
software
CorelDRAW
which
someone
had
given
to
him
as
a
gift
One
day
with
his
mother
napping
in
the
next
room
Koppelman
installed
the
program
on
his
computer
It
was
his
first
step
toward
becoming
a
forensic
sketch
artist
He
started
creating
lifelike
renderings
of
Jane
and
John
Does
based
on
photos
taken
postmortem
He
used
CorelDRAW
to
open
eyes
fill
in
sunken
cheeks
and
give
faces
more
dynamic
expressions
In
complicated
cases
where
bodies
had
decomposed
he
re-created
facial
structure
The
goal
was
to
make
the
dead
more
recognizable—to
loved
ones
searching
for
them
and
to
police
trying
to
identify
them
Once
he
finished
a
rendering
Koppelman
sent
it
to
NamUs
and
the
database
would
sometimes
publish
it
He
also
posted
his
work
on
Websleuths
so
other
armchair
detectives
could
use
it
in
their
identification
efforts
Eventually
Koppelman
began
working
with
police
departments
and
the
DNA
Doe
Project
which
identifies
human
remains
through
genetic
testing
and
genealogical
research
Glad
to
help
law
enforcement
generate
leads
and
in
some
instances
put
a
name
to
a
face
Koppelman
was
almost
always
an
unpaid
volunteer
His
renderings
were
instrumental
in
solving
several
cold
cases
including
the
identification
of
the
Caledonia
Cali
Jane
Doe
Tammy
Jo
Alexander
in
2015
But
before
all
that
in
2009
when
he
was
just
starting
out
as
an
amateur
sleuth
Koppelman
got
interested
in
the
case
of
the
Racine
County
Jane
Doe
When
she
was
found
near
the
edge
of
a
Wisconsin
cornfield
in
1999
the
young
woman
had
only
been
dead
about
12
hours
but
rain
had
washed
away
any
evidence
that
might
have
been
useful
to
investigators
It
seemed
likely
that
the
young
woman
had
been
murdered
elsewhere
and
dumped
An
autopsy
determined
that
she
may
have
been
cognitively
disabled
and
that
she
had
suffered
long-term
abuse
and
neglect
She
had
broken
bones
and
a
cauliflower
ear
and
her
body
showed
signs
of
sexual
assault
More
than
50
people
from
the
farming
community
where
she
was
found
attended
her
funeral
But
no
one
knew
her
name
or
what
had
happened
to
her
Her
gravestone
read
Gone
But
Not
Forgotten
—a
hope
more
than
a
description
Koppelman
read
everything
he
could
find
about
the
Racine
County
Jane
Doe
combing
through
news
articles
and
social
media
He
learned
that
she
had
hazel-green
eyes
two
piercings
in
each
ear
and
short
reddish-brown
hair
She
was
five-foot-eight
and
120
pounds
and
estimated
to
be
between
18
and
30
years
old
She
was
found
wearing
a
men
s
gray
and
silver
western-style
shirt
embroidered
with
red
flowers—a
design
the
manufacturer
told
police
from
the
mid-1980s
On
NamUs
Koppelman
plugged
in
some
general
search
criteria—gender
age
location—and
clicked
through
the
results
for
missing
persons
With
each
one
Koppelman
asked
himself
Could
this
be
her
In
most
cases
the
answer
was
a
clear
no
The
age
didn
t
match
or
the
location
made
no
sense
But
one
entry
gave
Koppelman
pause
Aundria
Bowman
Aundria
and
the
Racine
County
Jane
Doe
shared
physical
characteristics
and
their
ages
aligned
Aundria
would
have
been
25
in
1999
when
the
Jane
Doe
was
killed
Holland
where
Aundria
disappeared
sits
directly
across
Lake
Michigan
from
where
the
Jane
Doe
was
found—it
s
just
four
hours
by
car
from
one
location
to
the
other
tracing
the
lake
s
southern
shoreline
and
passing
through
Chicago
To
test
the
possible
identification
Koppelman
created
a
composite
image
superimposing
Aundria
s
photo
with
ones
from
the
Jane
Doe
s
autopsy
He
marked
the
similarities
in
red
Koppelman
took
his
theory
to
law
enforcement
who
found
it
compelling
enough
to
investigate
To
determine
whether
the
Jane
Doe
was
Aundria
police
would
need
to
compare
DNA
from
the
body
with
that
of
someone
in
Aundria
s
family
Because
Aundria
was
adopted
authorities
had
to
track
down
her
birth
mother
Koppelman
knew
that
could
take
a
while
or
that
it
might
never
happen
forcing
investigators
to
find
other
avenues
for
identification
As
the
police
did
their
part
Koppelman
kept
poking
around
online
learning
what
he
could
about
Aundria
One
day
at
the
end
of
2012
he
came
across
a
Classmates
com
page
for
Aundria—the
premium
kind
you
have
to
pay
to
keep
active
in
order
to
connect
directly
with
former
school
acquaintances
Was
this
Aundria
alive
and
well
and
trying
to
find
old
friends
And
if
it
wasn
t
her
who
was
it

Carle
Schlaff
wanted
more
out
of
his
job
As
an
FBI
agent
he
d
spent
more
than
ten
years
working
low-level
drug
cases
in
the
bureau
s
Denver
office
He
eventually
moved
up
to
investigating
organized
crime—only
to
be
transferred
to
the
violent-crimes
squad
and
made
the
liaison
to
a
low-security
prison
called
Englewood
in
Littleton
Colorado
It
was
the
sort
of
job
that
was
good
for
a
rookie
not
a
veteran
I
was
kinda
pissed
Schlaff
said

Support

Atavist
by
becoming
a
magazine
member
Schlaff
was
42
with
two
kids
an
easy
smile
and
an
unpretentious
manner
He
was
the
type
of
FBI
agent
who
read
crime
novels
in
his
spare
time
He
d
grown
up
watching
Hawaii
Five-0
He
wanted
to
take
down
mob
bosses
catch
serial
killers
expose
international
drug
cartels
In
August
2002
Schlaff
s
luck
changed
He
learned
that
a
prisoner
at
Englewood
named
Scott
Kimball
knew
about
a
murder
plot
Schlaff
and
a
colleague
met
with
Kimball
in
a
small
interview
room
at
the
prison
Kimball
was
36
at
the
time
a
weathered
stocky
man
who
wore
a
goatee
and
had
a
long
scar
in
the
center
of
his
forehead
He
shared
a
cell
with
Steve
Ennis
a
young
drug
dealer
Kimball
claimed
that
Ennis
had
talked
about
recruiting
someone
to
kill
witnesses
preparing
to
testify
against
him
I
would
be
willing
to
do
some
undercover
work
for
you
guys
Kimball
told
Schlaff
and
his
colleague
If
the
offer
seemed
blunt
it
was
because
Kimball
already
knew
how
the
FBI
operated
After
being
arrested
for
check
fraud
in
Alaska
in
2001
he
told
authorities
that
his
cellmate
Arnold
Wesley
Flowers
planned
to
order
the
murders
of
a
federal
judge
and
a
prosecutor
along
with
a
witness
in
the
case
against
him
Flowers
was
facing
fraud
charges
of
his
own
according
to
court
records
The
FBI
worked
with
Kimball
and
an
undercover
agent
to
record
Flowers
organizing
the
hits
with
help
from
his
girlfriend
In
March
2002
the
couple
were
charged
with
murder
for
hire
witness
tampering
and
attempting
to
murder
federal
officials
There
was
more
Kimball
told
the
FBI
that
another
Alaska
prisoner
Jeremiah
Jones
had
bragged
about
murdering
Tom
Wales
a
prominent
assistant
U.
S
attorney
shot
to
death
through
a
window
of
his
Seattle
home
in
October
2001
While
it
investigated
the
matter
out
of
concern
for
his
safety
the
FBI
transferred
Kimball
to
his
native
Colorado
in
April
2002
Now
at
Englewood
it
seemed
that
Kimball
had
yet
more
valuable
intelligence
to
offer
Before
Schlaff
went
chasing
Kimball
s
story
though
he
wanted
to
know
what
type
of
person
he
was
dealing
with
He
didn
t
mind
so
much
if
someone
had
committed
nonviolent
crimes
but
he
didn
t
want
to
work
with
an
informant
who
could
be
easily
discredited
What
s
the
worst
thing
you
ve
ever
done
Schlaff
asked
Kimball
Kimball
admitted
that
in
addition
to
his
crimes
in
Alaska
he
d
committed
fraud
in
Montana
and
served
time
there
He
excelled
at
check
forgery
Kimball
said
but
he
wanted
to
go
straight
It
sounded
plausible
to
Schlaff
who
d
reviewed
Kimball
s
record—he
didn
t
have
any
convictions
for
violent
crimes—and
had
checked
for
outstanding
warrants
Schlaff
scribbled
down
on
a
notepad
what
Kimball
told
him
After
leaving
Englewood
that
day
he
made
contact
with
the
Drug
Enforcement
Agency
and
the
U.
S
Attorney
s
Office
which
were
both
working
the
Ennis
case
Kimball
was
soon
reactivated
as
an
informant
with
Schlaff
as
his
handler
Their
goal
was
to
foil
the
alleged
murder
plot
and
charge
Ennis
for
orchestrating
it
All
the
pieces
were
falling
into
place
This
was
exactly
the
kind
of
case
Schlaff
had
been
craving
It
takes
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
as
Schlaff
likes
to
say—that
s
the
logic
behind
using
jailhouse
snitches
In
the
United
States
the
practice
has
a
history
as
troubling
as
it
is
long
Incentivized
by
the
promise
of
reduced
sentences
better
prison
conditions
and
financial
compensation
criminal
informants
sometimes
offer
cops
and
prosecutors
bad
information
which
can
lead
to
wrongful
convictions
and
other
miscarriages
of
justice
And
too
often
authorities
treat
informants
as
if
their
lives
matter
less
than
the
work
of
law
enforcement
In
recent
years
there
have
been
efforts
to
reform
the
way
authorities
handle
informants
But
back
when
Kimball
started
working
with
the
FBI
there
was
less
communication
among
law
enforcement
agencies
and
relatively
minimal
scrutiny
of
an
informant
s
history
It
was
easy
to
miss
the
kind
of
facts
from
a
person
s
past
that
might
have
made
authorities
think
twice
before
using
them
as
an
informant
It
takes
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
as
Schlaff
likes
to
say—that
s
the
logic
behind
using
jailhouse
snitches
In
the
United
States
the
practice
has
a
history
as
troubling
as
it
is
long
Born
in
Boulder
in
1966
Kimball
was
ten
when
his
parents
divorced
after
his
mother
came
out
as
gay
Around
that
time
according
to
Kimball
and
his
brother
a
neighbor
began
molesting
them
Kimball
told
me
the
abuse
continued
until
he
was
in
his
teens
The
neighbor
was
ultimately
sentenced
to
seven
years
in
prison
for
sexual
abuse
of
a
minor
According
to
people
who
knew
him
as
a
young
man
Kimball
seemed
haunted
by
his
past
He
once
tried
to
end
his
life
but
only
managed
to
wound
himself—the
source
of
the
scar
on
his
forehead
By
early
adulthood
Kimball
had
a
long
rap
sheet
In
1988
he
received
his
first
felony
conviction
for
passing
bad
checks
In
another
instance
he
was
charged
with
running
an
illegal
outfitting
business
in
Montana
helping
out-of-staters
hunt
elk
bear
moose
and
deer
Kimball
continued
to
commit
nonviolent
offenses
the
kind
that
Schlaff
later
saw
on
his
criminal
record
There
were
other
allegations
against
Kimball
far
more
unsettling
ones
but
due
to
a
series
of
decisions
made
by
law
enforcement
finding
them
would
have
required
some
digging
In
June
1993
Kimball
married
a
woman
named
Larissa
Mineer
They
moved
to
Spokane
Washington
and
had
two
sons
Though
they
divorced
in
1997
they
maintained
a
relationship
until
December
1999
when
Mineer
alleged
Kimball
raped
her
at
gunpoint
Kimball
claimed
he
hadn
t
harmed
or
threatened
Mineer—according
to
a
police
report
he
said
that
his
ex
was
trying
to
sway
a
custody
dispute
over
their
sons
in
her
favor
After
Mineer
failed
a
polygraph
the
police
decided
not
to
file
charges
Polygraphs
have
been
deemed
unreliable
by
the
American
Psychological
Association
and
the
National
Academy
of
Sciences
but
law
enforcement
still
use
them
to
quickly
ascertain
whether
someone
might
be
telling
the
truth
In
2000
Kimball
landed
in
prison
in
Montana
convicted
of
violating
probation
which
he
d
been
serving
for
a
fraud
offense
After
a
year
in
lockup
Kimball
was
transferred
to
a
halfway
house
but
a
month
later
he
went
on
the
lam
Mineer
alleged
that
he
came
back
to
Washington
broke
into
her
home
and
then
kidnapped
and
raped
her
This
time
the
Spokane
police
issued
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
But
when
Kimball
was
picked
up
for
fraud
in
Alaska
in
2001
and
then
became
an
FBI
informant
the
kidnapping
and
assault
charges
went
away
The
FBI
said
it
did
not
request
that
local
law
enforcement
drop
the
charges
As
a
result
when
Schlaff
looked
up
Kimball
s
record
none
of
Mineer
s
accusations
were
on
it
The
escape
from
the
halfway
house
was
there
but
Schlaff
wasn
t
too
worried
about
that—Kimball
had
been
near
the
end
of
his
sentence
when
he
d
slipped
away
Schlaff
spoke
to
Colton
Seale
an
FBI
special
agent
in
Alaska
who
said
that
Kimball
had
been
helpful
in
the
case
against
Flowers
and
his
girlfriend
Seale
who
is
now
retired
from
the
FBI
told
me
that
he
has
no
memory
of
whether
he
knew
about
Kimball
s
kidnapping
and
assault
charges
at
the
time
At
worst
Schlaff
thought
he
was
working
with
a
petty
con
artist
He
was
a
typical
wise
guy
Schlaff
told
me
He
had
an
answer
for
everything
But
Kimball
wasn
t
a
child
molester
or
a
murderer
He
seemed
like
the
type
of
informant
who
might
be
good
before
a
jury
The
truth
was
something
else
entirely
